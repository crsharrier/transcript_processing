### The Pragmatics of Gaslighting - Exploratory Data Analysis
#### BA Linguistics Dissertation - May 2023

This repository contains the appendices for my dissertation, including narrow transcriptions of four conversations between Piers Morgan and different guests, and a jupyter notebook outlining how these were produced.

The 'final product' transcript PDFs are found in Appendix 1.
Inside Appendix 2, you will find a jupyter notebook entitled 'transcript_conversion_notebook'. This is where the the transcripts are tagged and features counted. 
THIS PROJECT HAS NOT BEEN TIDIED. A lot of the data analysis, especially towards the end of the Jupyter notebook was kinda freestyled as my dissertation came to a close and things became more frantic. I have not yet revisited this project to reorganize the testing processes.

TeXworks was used to compile LaTeX files with the following compiler setting:
XeLaTeX + MakeIndex + BibTeX

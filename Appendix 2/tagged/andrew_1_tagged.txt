\spkr{Piers}\overmk{A1}do you respect women?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}absolutely why wouldn't I?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}do you think that 18 19 year old women
are more attractive than 25 year old women
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I think there's attractive people uh
that's that's a loaded question
I don't know\overmk{B1}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B1}}[well it's not really is it
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I I \overmk{B2}[can't say-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B2}}[you know why I'm asking you
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}of course I do but I can't \overmk{B3}[sit here and say-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B3}}[well for the benefit of viewers
who don't know why I'm asking you said this
in general
this is also one of the reasons men find youth attractive
you want to blow up the internet
I’ll block the internet right effing
now the reason 18 and 19 year olds are more attractive than 25 year olds is because they've been through less dick
people say oh you can't say that but yes I can
a 19 year old is more attractive than 26 year old woman
and I'll tell you why
because that 26 year old has talked to more guys
been to the club more times being
effed and dumped more times
more arguments more mess more for me to clean up
that is misogyny
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}why
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}because you are encouraging a mindset about 25 year old women
that makes them sound out to be
infinitely less desirable than 18 19 year olds
and having effectively been
having too much sex to be taken in a more respectful way
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that would- well firstly even if that was the case
that wouldn't be misogyny
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}but what did you mean by what you said
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that's not misogyny because it's not anti-women
I’m I'm saying that an 18 or a 19 year old woman
would be more \overmk{B4}[desirable (that’s not my)-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B4}}[it’s pretty anti-25 year old women
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}anti-25 year old women we can argue
but not \overmk{B5}[misogynistic lets-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B5}}[well that's misogyny though
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that's no no no it's \overmk{B6}[not.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B6}}[well being anti-any woman at all is misogyny
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}not when I'm not when I'm saying
that women are beautiful and attractive at a certain age
and saying that age is \overmk{B7}[(...)-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B7}}[you're saying 18 19 years are more attractive
than \overmk{B8}[25 year olds.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B8}}[well th- then ageist perhaps but misogynistic
\overmk{B9}[absolutely not.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B9}}[except (…) but you just accepted it was misogyny
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I didn't you said it was misogyny
I'm telling you no it's not
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}so you don't think if you're saying
slightly hateful things about a \overmk{B10}[25 year old-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B10}}[that's not slightly hateful
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well it is
you think you you say that to a woman's face if she's 25
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}it's not slightly hateful when \overmk{B11}[you’re-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B11}}[so you would go up to
a 25 year-old woman and tell her exactly what I've just read out
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}why would I walk up to a random 25 \overmk{B12}[year-old woman and say that?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B12}}[‘cause you said it in public
on the internet and it's been listened to
and watched by millions and millions of \overmk{B13}[young impressionable boys.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B13}}[correct, correct
there was a large panel
there was a conversation \overmk{B14}[there was hours longs of conversation=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B14}}[right.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=there were feminists attacking men
for toxic masculinity and attacking me and saying things
and I said things back which we're going to \overmk{B15}[antagonise them=

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B15}}[but I think see I'm I-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=so which you've done yourself b- a bunch of \overmk{B16}[times Piers.

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B16}}[I think a lot of allegations
of toxic masculinity are not toxic=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=correct=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I do think that kind of uh sentence
that y-I just read out that that paragraph
is actually toxic
if you genuinely mean that
and you say you wouldn't say it to a woman's face
but you said it in public about women of that age
I do think that's misogynist
and I think you probably do too
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I don't think it's misogynistic
I understand why it can be insulting \overmk{B17}[to say it to-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B17}}[you wouldn't say it to a woman's face
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I’d s- well it depends
you- you're making out like I'm walking around the street
going up to random \overmk{B18}[25 year-olds-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B18}}[well I think (…)
you're doing it to tens of millions of people online
there's no difference \overmk{B19}[is there?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B19}}[not at all we're discussing a topic
we we're discussing the the ideal age of a man\overmk{B20}[-

\spkr{Andrew}I th\overmk{B21}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B21}}[be honest
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I think that young boys in their teens lack life experience
they lack nuance

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B22}}[yeah but you know for a fact
millions of them are digesting exactly what you're saying
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}completely the entire internet to a degree
I think any any subject you can find
there's going to be a whole \overmk{B23}[heap of content-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B23}}[(yeah) I c- I come back to the
Joe Rogan thing Andrew is that
a lot of what you say I agree with=

\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=

\spkr{Piers}=right I do genuinely I’ve read a lot I’ve (written) a lot of stuff you said
a lot of the stuff you talk about I think
yeah he's got a good point right
(I think) we agree about a lot of things
but when I read that kind of thing and I'm like-
I just- how much of that is you
how much of that is some act
do you regret saying stuff like this\overmk{B24}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B24}}[I don't-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and actually do you see it as weakness
to admit you shouldn't have said something like that
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I don't live with regret
I think what's happened is that like I said
long format content arguments with feminists
arguments with the toxic masculine crowd
arguments with the left
and they're going to take a small clip
small sentence from hours
and they're going to try and paint me as a \overmk{B25}[(villain).

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B25}}[but I'm not left or right
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I don't know what you are Piers

\spkr{Piers}exactly that's my point
\overmk{B26}[no but- that's my point.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B26}}[and- and I understand
and and you're doing exactly as I knew would happen on this interview which is because you're a busy man
you're not gonna watch hours and hours and hours of video

\spkr{Piers}actually I haven't watched hours and hours of video
and I am going to come to the stuff where I agree with you
and I'm going to come to the stuff about your censorship
\overmk{B27}[which I have issues with so=

\spkr{Piers}=this is y’know It's a long interview right=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=sure=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I just thought off the top you said to me
and you were quite bold about it
well go on then let's go through this-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}and you and you should keep going
I will sit here and stand by what I said
I believe that \overmk{B28}[man-

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B28}}[on that
on that I just read to you then=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=do you wish you hadn't said that?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I understand how it's been misconstrued
I understand how it's been weaponized against me
do I regret it because it's been weaponized and used against me
well that's slightly annoying
did I\overmk{B29}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B29}}[that's not why I want you to-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}= did- did I at the time mean what I said
and in the context of the conversation
which obviously you you're not familiar with
and the people at home are not familiar with
no I meant what I said
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}the 25 year old women they’ve just
talked to more guys
been to the club more times
been effed and dumped more times
more arguments more mess more for me to clean up
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}well there's a whole bunch-
there's a whole bunch of context and conversation around that
that's been missed and \overmk{B30}[encourage people-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B30}}[I don't think I'm missing much context
\overmk{B31}[it's pretty-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B31}}[well I I encourage people who are interested to go watch it
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}right but I mean I’ve just read out three sentences
on the bounce there
I don't think there's any context I'm missing
I mean you’re-
you've made it pretty clear what you think about the difference
between 18 and 19 year old women
\overmk{B32}[and 26 year-olds.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B32}}[I wasn't talking about myself even
I was explaining I was talking with a Muslim guy who was on the panel
and he was explaining how youth is very valid
valued in most parts of the world=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=and why virginity is valued in most parts of the world
and the feminists were arguing against it
and I was sitting there actually very much like you
a mediator between the two explaining why
in most of the world still today
perhaps not in the Western World
virginity is coveted youth is coveted in most of the world
and per and throughout all of human history
and I was sitting there making the point explaining why
in certain parts of the world they think how they do
\overmk{B33}[even though it=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B33}}[well in large parts of the world-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=even though it's very different to the Western World
so I was making a point mediating between two groups
very similar to yourself
the conversation has been misunderstood
they've taken this clip of it and it's been weaponized and used against me
I understand that is because I'm now
the most famous Googled person on the planet
it's inconvenient sure
but I'm definitely not a danger to women in any regard
I date women 25 26 27 years old all the time
none of them are offended by the things \overmk{B34}[I say.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B34}}[I don't think
you're a danger to women \overmk{B35}[I think that- I think the danger=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B35}}[well of course not.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=if it if it concerns you
the danger is the influence you have on young men
to have this kind of mindset about women
and that's really what I'm trying to get to what you really believe
and how much you've just shot off
because you think it's like entertaining
and you haven't really given it much thought
and whether now you're a bit older
and you've had all the fallout
whether part of you is thinking actually if I hadn’t-
as Joe Rogan says
if you hadn't said stuff like this
you'd probably still be on these platforms
you'd be massively more popular
massively more famous
massively richer
so I'm really just trying to get to
on the blatantly misogynist stuff\overmk{B36}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B36}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=do you just wish you hadn't said it
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}with great power comes great responsibility=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=it was certainly said before the great power came
it's inconvenient to a degree
however like I said at the time
with the context of the conversation
I know that I'm not saying things
which I believe to be detrimental to the world however
they've been misconstrued and they've been misunderstood
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}y- b- if a 25 year old woman was watching this
would you say I'm sorry for saying that
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}oh I wouldn't want anyone to be offended by anything I say
but I say \overmk{B37}[things- but I say things that offend=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B37}}[if- but (…)-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=and this is the thing that's interesting Piers
please let me finish\overmk{B38}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B38}}[no but y- you
again you’re \overmk{B39}[behaving like a politician=

but if\overmk{B40}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B40}}[you do

let’s \overmk{B42}[accept we both our-

\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B42}}[no problem no problem no problem

if a 26 year old woman is watching this
and has heard those comments=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=would you just say to her
I- look I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I won't
I will say that I am sorry that that offends you
however there's a large contingent of the \overmk{B43}[world and th-

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B43}}[that doesn't mean
you're sorry
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I'm not sorry that's the point I'm making
I'm sorry if that offends you
however there's a large contingent of the world that believed that
and I was mediating for a conversation
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}parts of the world that believe that about 26 year old women
are parts of the world where women are not allowed out on their own
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that's your- that's a \overmk{B44}[conversation to have-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B44}}[they have to wear full burkas

\spkr{Andrew}that's nothing to do with me \overmk{B46}[(my friend).

I was mediating a \overmk{B48}[conversation.

\spkr{Andrew}I I don't live in a country where that happens

\spkr{Piers}you're using that as the excuse for why
you're not sorry for saying it\overmk{B49}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B49}}[it’s not an excuse

\spkr{Andrew}my- the reason \overmk{B52}[I’m-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B52}}[this isn't that hard Andrew
you can simply say Piers you know what
with the benefit of hindsight
I wish I hadn't said it like that
and if a 26 year old woman's watching
I'm sorry I said that
because that actually is blatantly misogynist
and even though that's the view held by other parts of the world
it's not a view I share
now I would respect you more if you said that=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=than if you try and say
well it’s said in other parts of the world

to be an absolute and utter realist

you're doing it again
what do you mean that's a truth in other parts of the world
that's what you said
it's not you're not talking about another part of the world
you're talking about what you believe is the difference
between 18 and 19 year olds and 26 year olds

\spkr{Andrew}I was talking about\overmk{B56}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B56}}[it’s your belief

\spkr{Andrew}I was talking about what the people on the panel believe the difference is

\spkr{Piers}so what do you think the difference is
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I think the difference is age
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}what's the difference then
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}well that a 26 year old’s older than a 19 year old
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}and so you stand by what you said
about talking to the guys
been to the club a more times
been effed and dumped more times\overmk{B57}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B57}}[well I-

\spkr{Andrew}no there's plenty of 26 year old women
who have been with one man or
or are virgins of \overmk{B58}[course.

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B58}}[right
so you don't believe that

is the only thing that's going to decipher
well how many men or \overmk{B59}[women you’ve slept with.

believe what you said just say sorry

\spkr{Piers}\overmk{A1}but there was also I think quite a disturbing piece
that BuzzFeed did and it talked about the the
negative impact of young impressionable male minds
when they've read or seen
some of the more inflammatory things you've said
and they quoted for example
Sandy uh 22 from Washington
my father's gone from a man
who minored in women's studies in college
he was kind and in touch with his emotions
treated all people men and women around him with kindness
to a man who says that whenever he sees an effeminate male stranger
he gets an overwhelming urge to murder them
he loves podcasts he listens a lot of podcasts
I know he's listened to Andrew Tate
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}woah woah woah let's stop for a second
let's be professional here Piers because you're a professional \overmk{B1}[as am I.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B1}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}firstly she said
did you say that my father went
she said my father \overmk{B2}[has gone?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B2}}[her father.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that's a full-grown man=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mhhm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=firstly so we're talking about my impact on children
you just talked about a full-grown man here
secondly I’ve never talked about murdering effeminate men
in anything online ever
on in any context ever
so I don't know why they have taken
some random person I’ve never met in the world
who's full grown an adult
and come to their own conclusions who I’ve never met
and lumped his name in with mine
that is absolutely unfair on every level
I didn't watch I didn't read \overmk{B3}[this BuzzFeed=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B3}}[what is your view-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I didn't read this BuzzFeed article=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=hmm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=but after hearing the first point
I know it's trash that is complete garbage
\overmk{B4}[to sit and say that I’m the reason=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B4}}[what is y- what is your view-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=this man believes what he believes
\overmk{B5}[(… disgusting).
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B5}}[I have seen a quote from you
and you can tell me what you feel here about this=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=sure=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=you talk about people don't want to see men dressed up in
dress i.e. transgender \overmk{B6}[people.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B6}}[that's not exactly what I said
\overmk{B7}[I said=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B7}}[what did- what did you say.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I said the reason I am so popular and I'm so famous
is that there's a large contingent of men
who don't want to wear makeup
who still want to make money
go to the gym be strong drive a fast car
be traditionally masculine and don't want to be shamed for that
and they don't want to be called toxic for that
that is the reason I'm so massively famous
that is what \overmk{B8}[I said.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B8}}[what do you think of transgender people
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}that's nothing to do with me
I'm not transgender and I don't understand the issue like they do
\overmk{B9}[they can do whatever they-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B9}}[are- are you transphobic do you- are you-
do you consider yourself that
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}transphob- wha- af- afraid?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}uhhh well it kind of yeah I- y- you \overmk{B10}[have a phobia-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B10}}[I don't live in fear my friend
I- I- n- I have no \overmk{B11}[prob-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B11}}[do you have a dislike of transgender people
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I don't know any transgender people
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}but do you have a dislike of what they stand for what they are
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no why would I I-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I don't know \overmk{B12}[I’m asking.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B12}}[that's not my issue that's not my issue
and that's actually quite interesting because
when I was attacked a lot of these stupid articles like BuzzFeed
because it's ridiculous that whole
that first point proves anyone with a brain knows that that's garbage=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=when they attacked me
they lump a whole bunch of things in together
they say misogynistic racist transphobic
they just put them all together at \overmk{B13}[random=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B13}}[nooo I don’t-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I’m mixed race\overmk{B14}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B14}}[by the way-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I I don't know where they get these
they just get these buzzwords \overmk{B15}[and put them in a sentence.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B15}}[Andrew Andrew by the way
I completely agree \overmk{B16}[and I’ve had=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B16}}[it's crazy.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and I’ve had the same thing done to me\overmk{B17}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B17}}[okay well there you go then.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and I'm not calling you anything
I'm asking you what you personally believe you are
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I it's not an issue I discuss
what I do discuss is \overmk{B18}[that-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B18}}[so you support transgender people?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}pe- tran I I support individual liberty I'm a libertarian
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}yeah so you support transgender people
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}sure sure why not
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}exactly yeah
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}so but my point is as a whole you're saying that I'm saying
I don't want to see men in dresses I'm saying no
\overmk{B19}[I’m saying that-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B19}}[do you support gay people?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}sure \overmk{B20}[I- I'm- I’m saying there's a=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B20}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=large contingent of men in the world
who like the idea of the traditional masculine view of the world
who feel happy when they watch 80s action heroes
with big muscles and they \overmk{B21}[run around=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B21}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=and there's nothing toxically masculine about having a fast car
and a beautiful girlfriend
and making a bunch of money and \overmk{B22}[being th=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B22}}[nothing at all?
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=absolutely and those are the people who are my fans
\overmk{B23}[and I’m s- and I’m saying-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B23}}[I agree but actually- but the problem is
okay I'm going to interrupt you \overmk{B24}[just to say this- no no-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B24}}[ts- ha- okay
okay but this you're saying that I have a problem with p-
men in dresses I'm saying no
the people who watch my \overmk{B25}[content-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B25}}[I’ve asked you that question you've answered
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}yeah but the people who watch my content
don't want to see men in dresses
clearly I don't wear a dress
that’s the \overmk{B26}[point I’m making.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B26}}[that’s not why they're watching your content
\overmk{B27}[because you're not wearing a dress.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B27}}[no no but that's the point I'm making
that's the point I was making
there's a large contingent of men
who are not interested in the things that's perhaps
the YouTube algorithms trying to feed
\overmk{B28}[them, they find my content.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B28}}[I think there are lots of- I I I look
when you support masculinity and masculine traits
I'm with you \overmk{B29}[right.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B29}}[okay so you
agree a man should protect and provide for a woman
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I- absolutely
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}okay so you agree if you're walking down the street
with a woman you'd be prov-
you'd be responsible with her safety
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}uh yeah
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}cool absolutely so if that woman wanted to
walk alone at \overmk{B30}[night then they-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B30}}[I don't think I have authority
over the woman \overmk{B31}[as you we do that.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B31}}[all right.
okay so let me ask you another question Piers
because we are professionals
let's say your woman decided she wanted to take a nice
little walk through the south side of Chicago at 2 A.M
and she wanted you to go with her and
you were responsible for fighting and dying on the spot
if she was attacked=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=don't you think you would say to her
no we're not going out right now it's not safe
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}yes
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}okay so you'd have authority to make the decisions
\overmk{B32}[so we agree.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B32}}[no I wouldn't
\overmk{B33}[I would say I don't think you should=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B33}}[so we make- so we agree.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}= if she decides to it's her own volition
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}w- w- well if she decides
you're not going to stop \overmk{B34}[her.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B34}}[I have no power to stop her
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}completely
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}but you think you do
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I don't think I have power to \overmk{B35}[stop her=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B35}}[well you clearly do
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=no I think I have power to make the decision
I think no that's not \overmk{B36}[sensible-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B36}}[so if you have the power to make a decision
you have the power to stop her
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}uh no \overmk{B37}[because it she-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B37}}[and that's where we differ
and that's why I think it's really interesting about you
I don't think you really think through what you're saying
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I think through what I'm \overmk{B38}[saying so carefully Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B38}}[because what-
yeah but Andrew you've literally just said
is that you have the power to stop her
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no I said I don't have the power to stop her
I'm not going to lock her in the room
I'm saying that \overmk{B39}[as a-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B39}}[so if she wants to go on her own
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}then she's going to go \overmk{B40}[but as a c-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B40}}[then you don’t have authority to stop her.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}okay but as a couple
if we're going to sit there and decide
if we're going to take this \overmk{B41}[date-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B41}}[you (asked if I’d rather)- sh- would I
feel a sense of responsibility for her safety
absolutely \overmk{B42}[absolutely=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B42}}[agreed so so let me finish Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=would I have the power or authority
to stop her doing it no
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no of course not so let me finish Piers
you're not going to stop her walking out the hotel
of course it's her decision she's a sovereign individual=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=my point is that usually in a couple
people have you'd sit there as a team and you discuss
and perhaps on certain issues
the woman will know more about X and she'll decide X
and the man might know more about Y and he'll \overmk{B43}[decide Y=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B43}}[hmm.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=so I'm saying if we're as a couple
and we're sitting there and deciding as a couple as a team
and she says she wants to take this late night stroll
I'm going to say you know what I'm going to veto this one
I'm going to call \overmk{B44}[veto on this one=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B44}}[but do you believe-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=‘cause it’s dangerous \overmk{B45}[which to a degree=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B45}}[right
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=would give me in that particular scenario
a degree of authority
if she said I don't want to listen to you \overmk{B46}[Andrew I=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B46}}[it doesn't give you authority
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=if she says I don't want to listen to you Andrew
I want to go on that walk
then what can I do
say well then \overmk{B47}[I- I hope-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B47}}[then you don’t have authority
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}uh- then I hope- I wish you the best \overmk{B48}[my love.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B48}}[but y- then you
don't have authority
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}cool then it's a semantic argument
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}not really
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I think it \overmk{B49}[is.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B49}}[it's the complete opposite of
what you said you had which was authority
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no problem Piers no problem
but I think I think \overmk{B50}[we actually-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B50}}[let me ask you about
what what do you believe about depression
do you believe depression is a real thing
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I believe that feeling depressed is real
I don't believe depression as a clinical disease is real no
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}really
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}correct you don't believe people can be clinically depressed
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I think PTSD is very real I’ve unfortunately
I have some friends who suffer from that=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I know that feeling depressed is real
I believe that the number one power you have against these things
are taking c- trying to take control of your own mind
and affecting your own life
I believe that it's not healthy to hand over all your power
and believe that depression is an outside disease
that you can't affect
I know that when I’ve had difficult periods in my life
and also many of my friends like I’ve said
suffer from PTSD and been through terrible things
I’ve lived a very difficult life and I know people who have
that the things that made them feel better
is when they woke up and said you know what
I'm not going to allow this to damage me anymore
I'm going to take responsibility
I'm going to get up and I'm going to fight this as hard \overmk{B51}[as I can-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B51}}[right and I’m-
and by the way on that I agree \overmk{B52}[right=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B52}}[so we agree.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=my favorite speech is the Rocky Balboa \overmk{B53}[one (to his son).
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B53}}[okay so then we agree
the \overmk{B54}[way- wha- no we do.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B54}}[no no here’s where we don't agree
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}uhhhh Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}you don't- now hang on
you- you've got to let me \overmk{B55}[interject when I don't agree with you \overmk{B56}[right.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B56}}[sure.				     	  \hspace{\offset{A1}{B57}}[sure.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}where I don't agree with you
is that there's no such thing as clinical depression
there absolutely is\overmk{B58}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B58}}[well-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=it's a proven scientific medical reality
there's a different argument about have we gone a bit too soft right
\overmk{B59}[in schools and \overmk{B60}[all the rest of it absolutely\overmk{B61}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B61}}[yeah.		    \hspace{\offset{A1}{B62}}[yeah.			   \hspace{\offset{A1}{B63}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=do I think some people moan and whine
too much about their lot in life definitely\overmk{B64}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B64}}[okay.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=are we a victimhood society 100 percent\overmk{B65}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B65}}[okay.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=is there such a thing as clinical depression absolutely\overmk{B66}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B66}}[so if some-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=and if- and my argument is
that if you actually bracket everybody who's not clinically depressed
and doesn't have the genuine medical condition
then actually if millions of people are deemed to have depression
the ones who really need the help don't get it\overmk{B67}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B67}}[well that-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=that's my point
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well that can that that I would agree with you're right
I think it's certainly a overused term
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}yeah but you don’t think-
you don’t accept there is such a thing as clinical depression
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}no I don't \overmk{B68}[‘cause-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B68}}[and that to me is a damaging view
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}okay well let me explain why
if someone comes to me and says I'm clinically depressed
or I feel very very sad
I would say the first thing you need to do
is stop accepting the identity of a clinically depressed person
stop accepting you have no control over this
and what you need to do is stop identifying that way
and let's work together to try and fight against \overmk{B69}[it.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B69}}[but there isn’t
an eminent doctor in the world
who would tell you there is no such thing
as clinical \overmk{B70}[depression=
\medskip

saying exactly that my friend

\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B73}}[he’s a journalist.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I said depression wasn't real long ago and was attacked for it
then Johann Hari wr- wr- wrote a book
\overmk{B74}[which is actually-

\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B74}}[what’s it got to do with Johann Hari?

most people\overmk{B75}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B75}}[Johann Hari is a journalist.

and if you fix the problem in their life
perhaps they won't feel depressed \overmk{B76}[anymore=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B76}}[yeah but-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=it's not a disease.

\spkr{Andrew}yeah but Andrew \overmk{B77}[you're not-

in other words there are a lot of people who just have a bad day=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and declare I’ve got depression=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=yeah=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and I I say well have you been to a doctor
have you been clinically diagnosed
if you have and you have clinical depression that's one thing
but if you haven't we could probably work on some mental strength
and resilience skills with you
but a a clinically depressed person
has a an absolutely proven medical condition
that is beyond their control
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}not according to me and many others my friend
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well look what do you know about it honestly
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I know I know \overmk{B97}[fr-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B97}}[you’re not a doctor are you
you're not trained are you
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I’m not a \overmk{B98}[doctor.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B98}}[you’re not a psychiatrist you're
none of those things=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=sure=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=you're a guy on the make he's done very well for himself
spouting stuff off
much of which I agree with as you've seen in the interview uh
but some of which is ludicrous and that's one of them
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}it's not ludicrous
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}it is
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}it's not \overmk{B99}[my friend.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B99}}[if you said to me
we're in a victimhood society it’s got to stop
I'm with you=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=okay=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=but the moment you try and deny clinical depression
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I believe feeling depressed \overmk{B100}[is real=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B100}}[mm.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I do not believe it's a disease that you catch from the sky
and you cannot affect
I believe that no matter what happens
I believe you have control over your own mind
and you can fight against it
I believe if you change your circumstances in your life
you may feel different
I'll give you a quick example
I had a guy who emailed me saying he was clinically depressed
and he was going to kill himself
I obviously am not a psychiatrist I'm not a doctor
I told him because I reply to my emails
I said have you been to a psychiatrist
he said yes I'm clinically depressed I’ve been on these pills
this amount of time I'm on antidepressants it doesn't work
I said I don't know what to say to besides this
and he s- he said he lost his girlfriend
that's why he became clinically depressed so I said listen
go to the gym get a six-pack first
once you've got six-pack email me again
if you still feel like killing yourself
I don't know what else to say to you but I'd say
strong body is a strong mind
go train
he went he started sending me progress pictures
emailing me him getting in better better shape
and eventually got a six-pack
he's now a professional bodybuilder
and he said I can't believe I was considering that
I feel so much better etc
the doctor was telling him he was clinically depressed and couldn't cure it
he started taking control of his own life
and now he felt better\overmk{B101}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B101}}[have you seen-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=now I'm not saying it's the case for everybody\overmk{B102}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B102}}[no no-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I'm just saying \overmk{B103}[I- I’m just-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B103}}[here’s my question though
have you seen the guy's medical records
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}of course not I just told you the story
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}so you’re just taking his word for it
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}oh I am taking the words of a man
who emailed me with a bunch of medication
and specific \overmk{B104}[doses-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B104}}[so you’re denying proven science
because one guy writes to you who you help
and you've not seen any evidence
he ever had clinical depression diagnosed
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I'm denying the idea that \overmk{B105}[if you’re-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B105}}[and on the back of it
you go on your your y’know rants in public
to tens of millions of people denying something
because this guy writes to you and says he had it and you cured him
and I think that's a dangerous mindset Andrew=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=that's fine=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and that's where you don't have a responsible view
of your \overmk{B106}[influence over people.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B106}}[disa- disagree it's very responsible
because I'm saving people's lives
I disagree that if you're dy- if you have- if you feel depressed
I disagree that you cannot affect it and change your life
and take control and fix yourself and feel happier
I disagree with \overmk{B107}[that=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B107}}[d’you think d’you think co-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I I ref- I refuse to accept that there are people out there
who cannot become happy contented individuals
I refuse to accept
we live in a world where God has created people
who no matter how hard they work
and how good their life becomes can't be happy
I don't accept that I accept that the universe is a very giving place
and that God loves all of us and if you try your best
and you work hard you can become a better person
and I also will argue with you
and I'll counter the point that you sitting here on your platform
telling people they have clinical depression
there's nothing they can do about it
is far \overmk{B108}[more dangerous-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B108}}[I didn’t say that
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}okay well then if they have \overmk{B109}[clinical depression-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B109}}[why do you mis- why do you misquote me
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no because you're \overmk{B110}[saying-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B110}}[you hate being misquoted
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}no you're saying if people have clinical depression
\overmk{B111}[that they- that they have a disease.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B111}}[I never said there’s nothing they can do about it
they go to a doctor and they get diagnosed\overmk{B112}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B112}}[cool.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and they get help
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}then I would argue the point that somebody\overmk{B113}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B113}}[it’s the complete
opposite of what you just said I said
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}I would argue the point that if somebody has depression of any kind
whether it's clinical whether it exists or not
whether they feel depressed or not whatever
that taking control of their life
taking personal responsibility and working hard
is always going to be the positive
best thing they can possibly do for their life going forward
\overmk{B114}[and the people going around them=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B114}}[how positive is it- how-
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=so sitting here saying I don't believe in clinical depression
you don't believe in depression
no I don't I believe that people can take control
and fight against things\overmk{B115}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B115}}[right.
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}=I believe in personal sovereignty
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}right fine
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}good so we agree
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}no we don’t
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}yes we do
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}no we don’t
\overmk{B116}[(you know…)-

\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B116}}[Piers you’re on my side
you’re afraid of being canceled along with me

\spkr{Piers}I \overmk{B117}[I said to you from the start=
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B117}}[we’re just- we’re- that’s all it is.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I agree with a lot of what you say
\medskip
\spkr{Andrew}completely so \overmk{B118}[we’re talking about-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B118}}[I but I'm taking you to task
over the stuff I don't agree with=

\spkr{Piers}\overmk{A1}Trisha you know you were there on Good Morning Britain
on the day the
uh well the morning after the Oprah Winfrey interview aired
we had a pretty lively series of exchanges on that show
as you know I left Good Morning Britain the next day
because I uh was asked to apologize
for disbelieving her claims of racism
I said I wanted to see evidence of this so-called racism
we now learn from Harry's own mouth
that they did not call the royal family racist \overmk{B1}[after all uh=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B1}}[they didn’t.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=so I'm not quite sure why I had to leave my job are you
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}yes \overmk{B2}[hhhhha=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B2}}[well go on, why?
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=um I-  because they actually didn't use the words racist \overmk{B3}[and-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B3}}[oh please
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}would you like me to finish
\overmk{B4}[they didn’t use-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B4}}[no I tell you what I want to do Trisha
before you go any further
I want to play you what they said on Oprah
then you can repeat \overmk{B5}[what you've just said=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B5}}[okay.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=let's watch \overmk{B6}[this.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B6}}[okay.
\medskip
**VIDEO CLIP PLAYS**
\spkr{Piers}yeah and the end of that first clip \overmk{B7}[of Meghan Markle=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B7}}[I did-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=goes on to say that if the baby was too dark
that would be a problem
yes you may \overmk{B8}[think that.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B8}}[well-  I- I- I \overmk{B9}[didn’t hear the word-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B9}}[so that I'm afraid Trisha
that is \overmk{B10}[racism=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B10}}[hang on just a minute-

\spkr{Piers}=th- the  charge \overmk{B11}[is w- lemme finish my question=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B11}}[oh no no no no no no no no-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=lemme finish my que(…)
the charge was racism against the royal family
at the time they \overmk{B12}[produced no evidence=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B12}}[I-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=her version of events was nearly two years
after Harry's timeline \overmk{B13}[for when this happened=

\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B13}}[Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=\overmk{B14}[they've never named the royal member who said this stuff and=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B14}}[could you- maybe- could you-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=now we get told casually it's not racism
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}all right can you just play that again
because uh there must be something wrong at my line
I didn't hear either Harry or Meghan use the word racism
I heard you use it
I saw the press use it
I didn't actually hear them use the word
and that's what w- when we had that robust exchange of of words
I think what I t- said to you is that I do get fed up
with other people labelling
white people labelling what is and isn't racist to to black people
now if they'd actually used the word racism \overmk{B15}[I would be agreeing-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B15}}[oh come off it Trish
uh- this- honestly this is utterly \overmk{B16}[ridiculous.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B16}}[so-
so what is racism \overmk{B17}[would you like to-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B17}}[she was asked by-

\spkr{Piers}=who I know is \overmk{B27}[the enemy to you=

\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B28}}[‘cause you know best.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=an example of racism
would be somebody expressing concern
about the skin colour of a baby
from a mixed-race marriage
and when the \overmk{B29}[when the interviewer then says what if it was darker=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B29}}[oh I don’t agree.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=that would be a problem
yes you may think that
that is an example of somebody expressing racism
and that became \overmk{B30}[the headline and narrative\overmk{B31}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B31}}[to you			      \hspace{\offset{A1}{B32}}[to you

and for you to shamelessly sit there
and pretend that wasn't \overmk{B33}[what they meant=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B33}}[I’m not pretending-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=\overmk{B34}[is utter bilge.

\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B34}}[if there-
if there were more black people in the media r-
in the you know erm in the Tabloid media
they may have h- had the opportunity to look into that
and explain it a little bit more
I didn't see it as racism
I saw it-
and that's why I got cross when you
you decided to label it (..) \overmk{B35}[er er racism=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B35}}[I didn't decide to do anything
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=I well in that when we were
having \overmk{B36}[that exchange, I-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B36}}[they literally confirmed to Oprah Winfrey\overmk{B37}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B37}}[I-

\spkr{Piers}=that a member of the royal \overmk{B38}[family=

\spkr{Piers}=had expressed concern
about the \overmk{B39}[skin colour of their baby=

\spkr{Piers}=and if the baby’s skin colour was too dark
\overmk{B40}[that would be a problem.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B40}}[when a black person attempts to talk about this
in other than headline news
when I'm trying to have a reasoned conversation
I get shouted over
why is my experience or what black people experience

no one has called the
the royal family racist I mean I \overmk{B44}[I=

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B44}}[oh for god’s sake honestly this is ridiculous
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=I would say it's built on built on the Commonwealth
and we already know Charles has had problems
you know they've talked about the crown
that Camilla may or may not use
er because the the history of one of the Diamonds
the Koh-i-Noor diamonds and what have you
we know that the royalty
uh and many royal families around the world
were built on the backs of slavery racism
commonwealth countries having goods stolen
or or taken away from them
we know that
unfortunately it's not taught in school
\overmk{B45}[so people are ignorant to that=

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B45}}[sorry that’s got nothing to do- sorry yeah but-

\spkr{Trisha}=\overmk{B46}[but I that- the the history=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B46}}[with respect Trisha that has nothing to do-

\spkr{Trisha}=the history is racist \overmk{B47}[the history is based on racism-

without me jumping in sorry
uh \overmk{B48}[with great respect to you you can't just keep talking=

\spkr{Piers}=I'm allowed to ask questions it's an interview
right my \overmk{B49}[my question for you is-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B49}}[yes you are but you're not allowed to make statements
\overmk{B50}[without listening to what somebody says.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B50}}[right- why-
yeah Meghan Markle made a direct charge
supported by her husband
that a member of the royal family had expressed concern
about the potential \overmk{B51}[skin colour of their baby=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B51}}[yes.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=which if it was \overmk{B52}[too dark would be a problem=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B52}}[yep.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=that is \overmk{B53}[racism=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B53}}[yeah.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=they \overmk{B54}[made a charge-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B54}}[oh is it? \overmk{B55}[what- really?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B55}}[yes that's called racism yeah
if you \overmk{B56}[think that if a baby's too dark it's a problem=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B56}}[oh you know about that.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=that's called racism sorry to have to lecture \overmk{B57}[you about racism=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B57}}[is it?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I know I'm not allowed to \overmk{B58}[as a white man but actually=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B58}}[oh good!
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=that is an example \overmk{B59}[of racism.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B59}}[no you know everything!
tell us about my hist- uh
tell us about the history of black people
and what ra- um what-
\overmk{B60}[what racism we go through.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B60}}[what's that got to do with what they said?
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}because they didn't say it was racism\overmk{B61}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B61}}[yes they did
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=somebody else used that word
they stepped aside from using that word
I think very deliberately
\overmk{B62}[and and you know=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B62}}[why did they win an award-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=tell us about unconscious \overmk{B63}[tell us about=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B63}}[alright why did they-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}=tell us about unconscious bias
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I'll tell you about unconscious delusion which is
they won an \overmk{B64}[award-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B64}}[no bias what does it mean
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I do the questions you do the answering
it's called an interview show right
(just) before Christmas they accepted an award
for their heroic heroic stand
against the structural racism of this royal family
based on what they told Oprah Winfrey
that was all a complete lie
there was no racism we now know
they never meant to say it was racism
you're supporting them
that was never meant to be racism
querying the colour of a baby from a mixed race marriage
and expressing concern if it \overmk{B65}[was going to be too dark=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B65}}[it’s unconscious bias.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}= it's not racism
Trish you take me for a complete mug
it couldn't be \overmk{B66}[a clearer example of racism=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B66}}[yes!
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=why \overmk{B67}[deny that?
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B67}}[oh really?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}yeah
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}so so am I right in thinking that you know better than you you
I have no idea of what racism is \overmk{B68}[but you do?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B68}}[no I didn't say that
I didn’t say that
I said to you very \overmk{B69}[clearly-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B69}}[oh y- sorry that you
\overmk{B70}[you are more-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B70}}[sorry I didn’t s-
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\overmk{B71}[you are more learned-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B71}}[what you keep doing
Trisha what do you keep doing
you keep putting words into my mouth I'm not actually saying
and the viewers aren't stupid
\overmk{B72}[they can hear the conversation.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B72}}[well that’s that’s what people did with them
they didn't use \overmk{B73}[racism y- y-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B73}}[you are
you want people to believe that actually what she said
Meghan Markle to Oprah Winfrey supported by Harry
does not constitute racism and I’m afraid
\overmk{B74}[everyone watching this will think you are being deliberately=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B74}}[no I said it was unconscious bias
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=either delusional or disingenuous which one is it?
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}you haven't explained what you understand by unconscious bias
\overmk{B75}[so I'm not quite sure you understand it.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B75}}[(no) I don't care you’re not doing the interview \overmk{B76}[I am.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B76}}[ahhh ahhhh
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}no I don’t care sorry
we've now moved from racism to unconscious bias
right \overmk{B77}[I would like to move to unconscious or conscious delusion=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B77}}[yes.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=because we all know what she said to Oprah Winfrey
we all know that for the last two years
the royal family has been reeling from the charge of being racist
because one of their \overmk{B78}[senior members expressed concern=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B78}}[oh (no-) heavens.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=over the skin colour of their unborn baby
\overmk{B79}[and now we get told casually by Harry=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B79}}[(oh heavens).
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=clearly feeling a bit of remorse about what's gone down here because
I read the whole book today
this story doesn't appear in the book
this \overmk{B80}[allegation of racism isn't in there=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B80}}[ah.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}why where is it gone
\overmk{B81}[nor is the- nor is the allegation where Meghan Markle=
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B81}}[why!
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=which is the other thing I queried at the time
before I had to leave the building
I also said where is the proof
that she went to somebody at Buckingham Palace
about her suicidal thoughts and was told she couldn't get help
that's not in the book either where's that gone
and by the way what happened to him at the same time
when his brother allegedly attacked him
he called his therapist who was on speed dial
why couldn't he do that for his wife
anyway these are ponderous questions for you to think about Trisha
I wanna come back \overmk{B82}[to- after the break.
\medskip
\spkr{Trisha}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B82}}[hahahaha.

\spkr{Susanna}\overmk{A1}you must have known
when you wrote your very public \overmk{B1}[facebook post=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B1}}[uhuh.
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}=just how sensitive \overmk{B2}[those words were going to be um=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B2}}[uhuh.
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}=i don't have the energy to talk about
the racial violence of white people\overmk{B3}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B3}}[mhmm.
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}=um most of you refuse to acknowledge
your existence privilege and success as a race is built
on the backs blood and death of people of color\overmk{B4}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B4}}[mhmm.
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}=um do you think that all white people are racist
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}i don't think that all white people are by nature racist
um from conception to birth
i think that  we are all the same um
but we need to speak about how we're socialized as a people
and er my resp- my um post was based on socialization
and racism as a structure
um I think as a society we’re just taught certain things
we're taught that men are superior to women
we're taught that women are meant to be submissive
we're told that gay people are meant to be ashamed of their sexuality
but it doesn't mean that this is how things need to be
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}do you think all people
all white people are responsible for that
or \overmk{B5}[believe that or?
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B5}}[um I don't think that all white people believe it no
i think that there is cases um
well I mean there's loads of allies I mean
you don't need to think this way
and it takes actively dismantling racism to be an ally
because if you're not doing anything then how are you helping racism
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}so you s- you said uh when you explained about this
you said white people are racist due to socialization
in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist\overmk{B6}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B6}}[uhuh.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic so\overmk{B7}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B7}}[yes.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=I’m a white straight male guy\overmk{B8}[=

\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B8}}[it’s not about you though-

\spkr{Piers}=so basically I’m like I’m like enemy number one\overmk{B9}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B9}}[no
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=so I’m a racist sexist homophobe
by your \overmk{B10}[logic.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B10}}[well yeah sexist yes but I \overmk{B11}[wouldn’t-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B11}}[I’m not sexist
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}some of the things \overmk{B12}[you say (…)-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B12}}[and I’m not racist
and I’m not a homophobe
so who are you with the greatest of respect to you
who are you to say that every
straight white guy \overmk{B13}[in the world is a-
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B13}}[I did not say that.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well you did you said white people are racist
due \overmk{B14}[to socialization=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B14}}[I just-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist
heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic
you are calling straight white guys like me
a series of offensive stereotypical labels
\overmk{B15}[which I find I find very offensive.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B15}}[and this is where there’s a problem-
okay this is why there's a problem
because you're taking it \overmk{B16}[personally.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B16}}[there is a problem
I am taking it personally
\overmk{B17}[yes.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B17}}[it isn’t about \overmk{B18}[you though Piers.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B18}}[when you say all white people are racist
as a white person \overmk{B19}[i find that offensive.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B19}}[please let me speak
please let me speak instead of speaking over me
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}the floor is yours
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}okay so basically instead of taking it personally
please think about how to be part of the solution
\overmk{B20}[rather than the problem.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B20}}[why don’t you think about being part of the solution
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}I am part of the \overmk{B21}[solution.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B21}}[you're not
you're causing more division\overmk{B22}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B22}}[I’m not causing more division
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=you you're basically causing more division\overmk{B23}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B23}}[Piers, by speaking about-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=by- by \overmk{B24}[telling all white people they’re racist.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B24}}[Piers please let me speak Piers let me speak
by talking about racism is not causing a divide
there's a divide anyway
we need to be speaking about what the s-
what the root of racism what the root of sexism is
and sexism doesn't come from women
so of course it's caused by men
this is a social \overmk{B25}[contract.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B25}}[you don't think women can be sexist
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}i don't think that women can enforce uh \overmk{B26}[misogyny like-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B26}}[what a load of nonsense.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}no because it's all\overmk{B27}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B27}}[you don't think any women

\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B28}}[women don't uphold the patriarchy Piers
that is \overmk{B29}[not the case.

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B30}}[what’s that
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}you don't know what the \overmk{B31}[patriarchy is?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B31}}[i do but explain it
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}the patriarchy is basically a structure that puts men at the top of power=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}=so \overmk{B32}[it’s it’s not women that enforce the patriarchy=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B32}}[the five most- the five-
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}=\overmk{B33}[’cause women don’t have anything to err-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B33}}[the five most powerf-   the five most
powerful people in this country currently are women
how does that how does that sit with your patriarchy
\overmk{B34}[they are.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B34}}[so you're saying that the patriarchy doesn't exist
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}I’m saying the five most powerful people in britain are women
so this idea that men still rule the entire planet
\overmk{B35}[and are these evil creatures to be removed from power=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B35}}[so you’re sayng that the patriarchy doesn’t exist
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=\overmk{B36}[doesn’t really stack up with the facts.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B36}}[you can say that the patriarchy doesn’t exist Piers
but the patriarchy exists \overmk{B37}[it’s a fact.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B37}}[my- my point about this is
there are of course there are serious
debates to be had about racism
but my god the world has moved and moved fast
\overmk{B38}[from where it used to be I don’t-

\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B38}}[Piers you are part of the problem \overmk{B39}[if you think this=

\spkr{Munroe}=you are part of the problem Piers

\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B41}}[you’re speaking over me for one
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well no now you're playing your old trick of being the victim
and you played that very- you
you immediately came out after you were fired
with all the stuff about all the insults you've had and so on and so on
of course you're going to get insulted
I don't agree with the way they've insulted you
but when you call every white person racist
\overmk{B42}[and say we’re all-
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B42}}[Piers my mother’s wor- my moth- my mother’s words.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}fine well when you say
i don't have the energy to talk about
the racial violence of white people anymore
yes all white people
when you call us a bunch of violent racists
\overmk{B43}[all of us=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B43}}[where does slavery come from?
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=all of us
we are going to get annoyed

\spkr{Munroe}yeah of course but look at the responses that I got that I’ve got
how dare you call us racist you black
how dare you call \overmk{B44}[us racist=

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B48}}[you can find abusive responses-

\spkr{Munroe}Piers I came in here to speak
I came in here to speak \overmk{B49}[Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B49}}[you did and I came in
and I also wanted you in here
so that I could look you in the eye
and say I think what you said was \overmk{B50}[(…)-

\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B50}}[so you're
making it about you \overmk{B51}[Piers-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B51}}[no what it's my show
along with \overmk{B52}[Susanna.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B52}}[okay why don't you just sit here
and talk for five minutes then
and I just sat- \overmk{B53}[sit here-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B53}}[uh you've done plenty of talking Munroe
I’ve been watching your interviews
I want you to explain why we shouldn't be offended
as white people
by your sentence that all white people
all white people are party to racial violence
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}because socialization has placed
all white people in a certain privilege
that means that if you are not dismantling racism
or helping to dismantle racism
then you are part of the problem
because you that makes you complicit
you need to actively work with people of color
to put diversity which this campaign was about
into place and when L'oreal fires me
for speaking about the origins of racism
then that goes completely against what diversity is
because the reason why we need diversity is
because we have racism \overmk{B54}[in society.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B54}}[you don't think any white people
on the planet are currently doing what you've just suggested
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}I didn't say that
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}you by implication when you say
\overmk{B55}[all white people that is what you’re saying.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B55}}[I’m talking about a structure
I’m talking about a structure that all white people sit on
I’m talking about society I’m not talking about
literally every single white person
I’m talking about society and
all white people exist within that structure
\medskip
\spkr{Susanna}well I’m I’m asking if you
regret the form of words
because of the \overmk{B56}[way they come across?
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B56}}[no I don't refr- regret the form of words
i mean I’m an activist and at the end of the day
activists aren't there to go and say a bunch of stuff
that people like
we are there to call things out and to make change
and yes I said all white people because
all white people have access to the privileges
um that are-
\overmk{B57}[that come out of colonialism and slavery=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B57}}[really really you think that the y-
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}=\overmk{B58}[yes!
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B58}}[you think you think the hundreds of thousands
of people on food banks in this country
white people amongst them
are are \overmk{B59}[privileged, do you?
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B59}}[they have more count
they have more \overmk{B60}[privileges-
\medskip

\spkr{Munroe}i did not say that I did \overmk{B61}[not say that-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B61}}[a wealthy supermodel
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}i did not- uh please show me my bank account
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}all right you'll be you’ll make a lot of money out of this so
let me ask you again do you think that
white people on food banks in this country
are more or less privileged than you
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}I did not say that Piers I said\overmk{B62}[-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B62}}[you just implied that
you said that \overmk{B63}[all white people had privileges.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B63}}[no Piers-
let me speak please I’m saying that if a person is at th-
the food banks and their white
and there's their counterpart
and that counterpart is black
that white person has more of a chance of getting out that situation
than their black \overmk{B64}[counterpart.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B64}}[why where's the evidence for that
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}because of white privilege
\overmk{B65}[they have-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B65}}[really
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}white people have more access to
home- \overmk{B66}[to housing, to credit-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B66}}[so so- poor white people just to clarify
poor white people have a better chance in Britain
of getting out of their poverty than
than poor black \overmk{B67}[people?
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B67}}[yes.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}all of them

\spkr{Piers}which you've managed to turn into a massive great story
of your poor victimhood
and I’m telling you
now you're sitting here that I think when you say
all white people are racially violent=

\spkr{Munroe}=mm=
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=that is deeply offensive and I think when you then clarify
\overmk{B69}[and say that straight=

\spkr{Piers}=straight white guys are basically all sexist homophobes

\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=i as a straight white guy
who's not remotely racist get very offended by that

because I do take it personally \overmk{B72}[yes.

\overmk{B74}[people with extreme pri- privilege like yourself=

\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B76}}[good bad and ugly all of us right
I I resent the idea that all
white people in this modern era
are automatically more privileged

I don't think that's right anymore
i think it's a complete mischaracterization

i get it I just said that

that all white people are racially violent

the syllabus is so white
why we are not taught about the violence of slavery in schools
why aren't we aren’t talk about the violence of um colonialism
why we're not taught about the violence of the empire
we are taught a whitewashed history
kids are not taught about black history in the same way
that they are taught about white \overmk{B83}[history.

that's not what got the headlines \overmk{B85}[what-

the bookends got taken out

what you actually posted

Piers Andrew
do you respect women? 

absolutely why wouldn't I?

do you think that 18 19 year old women 
are more attractive than 25 year old women 

I think there's attractive people uh 
that's that's a loaded question 
I don't know[-

            [well it's not really is it 

I I [can't say-

     [you know why I'm asking you 

of course I do but I can't [sit here and say- 

  		       [well for the benefit of viewers 
who don't know why I'm asking you said this 
in general 
this is also one of the reasons men find youth attractive 
you want to blow up the internet 
I’ll block the internet right effing 
now the reason 18 and 19 year olds are more attractive than 25 year olds is because they've been through less dick 
people say oh you can't say that but yes I can 
a 19 year old is more attractive than 26 year old woman 
and I'll tell you why 
because that 26 year old has talked to more guys
been to the club more times being 
effed and dumped more times 
more arguments more mess more for me to clean up 
that is misogyny 

why 

because you are encouraging a mindset about 25 year old women 
that makes them sound out to be 
infinitely less desirable than 18 19 year olds 
and having effectively been 
having too much sex to be taken in a more respectful way 

that would- well firstly even if that was the case 
that wouldn't be misogyny

but what did you mean by what you said 

that's not misogyny because it's not anti-women 
I’m I'm saying that an 18 or a 19 year old woman 
would be more [desirable (that’s not my)-

   [it’s pretty anti-25 year old women 

anti-25 year old women we can argue 
but not [misogynistic lets-

  [well that's misogyny though 

that's no no no it's [not. 

         [well being anti-any woman at all is misogyny 

not when I'm not when I'm saying 
that women are beautiful and attractive at a certain age 
and saying that age is [(...)-

    [you're saying 18 19 years are more attractive
than [25 year olds.

         [well th- then ageist perhaps but misogynistic 
[absolutely not. 

[except (…) but you just accepted it was misogyny 

no I didn't you said it was misogyny 
I'm telling you no it's not

so you don't think if you're saying 
slightly hateful things about a [25 year old-

      [that's not slightly hateful

well it is 
you think you you say that to a woman's face if she's 25 

it's not slightly hateful when [you’re- 

  		 		   [so you would go up to 
a 25 year-old woman and tell her exactly what I've just read out

why would I walk up to a random 25 [year-old woman and say that?

     [‘cause you said it in public 
on the internet and it's been listened to  
and watched by millions and millions of [young impressionable boys.

            [correct, correct
there was a large panel
there was a conversation [there was hours longs of conversation=
				 
          [right.

=there were feminists attacking men 
for toxic masculinity and attacking me and saying things 
and I said things back which we're going to [antagonise them=

 						     [but I think see I'm I-

=so which you've done yourself b- a bunch of [times Piers.

      [I think a lot of allegations 
of toxic masculinity are not toxic= 

=correct=

=I do think that kind of uh sentence 
that y-I just read out that that paragraph 
is actually toxic 
if you genuinely mean that 
and you say you wouldn't say it to a woman's face 
but you said it in public about women of that age 
I do think that's misogynist 
and I think you probably do too 

I don't think it's misogynistic 
I understand why it can be insulting [to say it to-

    [you wouldn't say it to a woman's face 

I’d s- well it depends 
you- you're making out like I'm walking around the street 
going up to random [25 year-olds-

[well I think (…) 
you're doing it to tens of millions of people online 
there's no difference [is there?

 [not at all we're discussing a topic 
we we're discussing the the ideal age of a man[-

[should 
should young boys right in their teens 
are you comfortable that they would have that mindset 

I th[-

     [be honest 

I think that young boys in their teens lack life experience 
they lack nuance 
and they need to be very very careful what they're digesting online 
whether it's my content or anybody else's [I think- 

  [yeah but you know for a fact 
millions of them are digesting exactly what you're saying 

completely the entire internet to a degree 
I think any any subject you can find 
there's going to be a whole [heap of content- 

 [(yeah) I c- I come back to the
Joe Rogan thing Andrew is that 
a lot of what you say I agree with= 

=yeah= 

=right I do genuinely I’ve read a lot I’ve (written) a lot of stuff you said 
a lot of the stuff you talk about I think 
yeah he's got a good point right 
(I think) we agree about a lot of things 
but when I read that kind of thing and I'm like-
I just- how much of that is you 
how much of that is some act 
do you regret saying stuff like this[=

[I don't-

=and actually do you see it as weakness 
to admit you shouldn't have said something like that 

no I don't live with regret 
I think what's happened is that like I said 
long format content arguments with feminists 
arguments with the toxic masculine crowd
arguments with the left 
and they're going to take a small clip 
small sentence from hours 
and they're going to try and paint me as a [(villain).
 
  [but I'm not left or right 

I don't know what you are Piers 

exactly that's my point 
[no but- that's my point. 

[and- and I understand 
and and you're doing exactly as I knew would happen on this interview which is because you're a busy man 
you're not gonna watch hours and hours and hours of video 

actually I haven't watched hours and hours of video 
and I am going to come to the stuff where I agree with you 
and I'm going to come to the stuff about your censorship 
[which I have issues with so= 

[sure.

=this is y’know It's a long interview right= 

=sure= 

=I just thought off the top you said to me 
and you were quite bold about it 
well go on then let's go through this- 

and you and you should keep going 
I will sit here and stand by what I said 
I believe that [man- 

              [on that 
on that I just read to you then= 

=yeah=

=do you wish you hadn't said that? 

I understand how it's been misconstrued 
I understand how it's been weaponized against me 
do I regret it because it's been weaponized and used against me 
well that's slightly annoying 
did I[= 

        [that's not why I want you to-

= did- did I at the time mean what I said 
and in the context of the conversation 
which obviously you you're not familiar with 
and the people at home are not familiar with 
no I meant what I said 

the 25 year old women they’ve just
talked to more guys 
been to the club more times 
been effed and dumped more times 
more arguments more mess more for me to clean up 

well there's a whole bunch- 
there's a whole bunch of context and conversation around that 
that's been missed and [encourage people-

      [I don't think I'm missing much context 
[it's pretty-

[well I I encourage people who are interested to go watch it

right but I mean I’ve just read out three sentences 
on the bounce there 
I don't think there's any context I'm missing 
I mean you’re-
you've made it pretty clear what you think about the difference 
between 18 and 19 year old women 
[and 26 year-olds.

[I wasn't talking about myself even 
I was explaining I was talking with a Muslim guy who was on the panel 
and he was explaining how youth is very valid 
valued in most parts of the world=

=mm=

=and why virginity is valued in most parts of the world 
and the feminists were arguing against it 
and I was sitting there actually very much like you 
a mediator between the two explaining why 
in most of the world still today 
perhaps not in the Western World 
virginity is coveted youth is coveted in most of the world 
and per and throughout all of human history 
and I was sitting there making the point explaining why 
in certain parts of the world they think how they do 
[even though it=

[well in large parts of the world-

=even though it's very different to the Western World 
so I was making a point mediating between two groups 
very similar to yourself 
the conversation has been misunderstood 
they've taken this clip of it and it's been weaponized and used against me 
I understand that is because I'm now 
the most famous Googled person on the planet 
it's inconvenient sure 
but I'm definitely not a danger to women in any regard 
I date women 25 26 27 years old all the time 
none of them are offended by the things [I say.

[I don't think
you're a danger to women [I think that- I think the danger=

           [well of course not.

=if it if it concerns you 
the danger is the influence you have on young men 
to have this kind of mindset about women 
and that's really what I'm trying to get to what you really believe 
and how much you've just shot off
because you think it's like entertaining 
and you haven't really given it much thought 
and whether now you're a bit older 
and you've had all the fallout 
whether part of you is thinking actually if I hadn’t- 
as Joe Rogan says 
if you hadn't said stuff like this 
you'd probably still be on these platforms 
you'd be massively more popular 
massively more famous 
massively richer
so I'm really just trying to get to 
on the blatantly misogynist stuff[=

         [yeah.

=do you just wish you hadn't said it 

with great power comes great responsibility=

=mm=

=it was certainly said before the great power came 
it's inconvenient to a degree
however like I said at the time 
with the context of the conversation 
I know that I'm not saying things 
which I believe to be detrimental to the world however 
they've been misconstrued and they've been misunderstood 

y- b- if a 25 year old woman was watching this 
would you say I'm sorry for saying that 

oh I wouldn't want anyone to be offended by anything I say 
but I say [things- but I say things that offend=

	    [if- but (…)-

=and this is the thing that's interesting Piers 
please let me finish[- 

          [no but y- you 
again you’re [behaving like a politician= 

          [please-

=but hang on you can say I'm interrupting 
but if[-

         [you do

but you're answering a different question to the one I asked you 
so as an interviewer you’re [b- you’re behaving- 

[sure okay sure ask- sure okay lis- sure ask-

okay you accept that
let’s [accept we both our- 

        [no problem no problem no problem

okay so again my point is simply 
if a 26 year old woman is watching this 
and has heard those comments=

=yeah=

=would you just say to her 
I- look I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that 

no I won't 
I will say that I am sorry that that offends you 
however there's a large contingent of the [world and th-

 [that doesn't mean
you're sorry 

no I'm not sorry that's the point I'm making 
I'm sorry if that offends you 
however there's a large contingent of the world that believed that 
and I was mediating for a conversation

parts of the world that believe that about 26 year old women 
are parts of the world where women are not allowed out on their own 

that's your- that's a [conversation to have-

 		           [they have to wear full burkas

well that's a [conversation to have-

           [they’re not allowed to drive cars 

that's nothing to do with me [(my friend). 

   [but is that the kind of 
world for a woman that you [are (…) ?

   	  [I was mediating a c- 
I was mediating a [conversation. 

        [(well) I'm asking you what you think 

I I don't live in a country where that happens 

you're using that as the excuse for why 
you're not sorry for saying it[=

				 [it’s not an excuse

=is that there are parts of the world but this is fine[= 

    [my friend-

=so my question to you is what do you think is fine?

I don't think it's fine I live in a world where[- 

 [you don't think it's fine 

my- the reason [I’m- 

    [this isn't that hard Andrew 
you can simply say Piers you know what 
with the benefit of hindsight 
I wish I hadn't said it like that 
and if a 26 year old woman's watching 
I'm sorry I said that
because that actually is blatantly misogynist 
and even though that's the view held by other parts of the world
it's not a view I share 
now I would respect you more if you said that=

=yeah= 

=than if you try and say 
well it’s said in other parts of the world 
so I'm not sorry 

I think [you y- 

[that doesn't tell me what you think 

then you need to understand why my content existed in the first place 
my content existed because I tried my very hardest 
to be an absolute and utter realist 
especially with uncomfortable truths=

=hmm=

I was pointing out that very [uncomfortable tr-

             [is that a truth then

it's an uncomfortable truth in many parts of the world 
it's not a truth that I'm happy about 
it's not a truth [that I’ve created- 

 		 [well hang on hang on no hang on 
you're doing it again 
what do you mean that's a truth in other parts of the world 
that's what you said
it's not you're not talking about another part of the world 
you're talking about what you believe is the difference 
between 18 and 19 year olds and 26 year olds 

I was talking about[- 

   	          [it’s your belief 

I was talking about what the people on the panel believe the difference is 

so what do you think the difference is 

I think the difference is age 

what's the difference then 

well that a 26 year old’s older than a 19 year old 

and so you stand by what you said 
about talking to the guys 
been to the club a more times
been effed and dumped more times[=

				 	    [well I- 

=do you believe that or not 

no there's plenty of 26 year old women 
who have been with one man or 
or are virgins of [course.

    [right 
so you don't believe that 

I don't think that the age 
is the only thing that's going to decipher 
well how many men or [women you’ve slept with. 

 			     [right so if you don't actually 
believe what you said just say sorry 

it's not about not believing what I'm saying 
it's about you understanding that there's 
large conversations going on [(in this context).

    [I'm just reading back 
stuff you've said[=

     [I know you are

=and I'm asking you do you believe it 

I believe that it's more likely 
a 26 year olds had more partners than a 19 year old 

you don't know that 

I don't know that you're right 

in fact there could be absolutely no evidence for that whatsoever 

completely agree 

so why say it 
why stigmatize all 26 year old women 

we’re- it's not that- we're repeating ourselves here [Piers. 

     [we’re not really 
I'm just trying to get to what you actually believe 

I believe that men find youth attractive in general 
I believe that in the context of the [conversation- 

  					[25 year-old women aren't old 

I agree with you they're not especially they're I'm I’m old 
you're you know I'm a lot older than that

hmm

the point I was making was part of mediating a panel 
a conversation between feminists 
and some Muslim guys[=

     [I get it I get it but you weren’t-

=okay good so you understand why I said the sentence

but as far as I know you weren't espousing 
what a Muslim man might think 
you were espousing what you think 

I was espousing what the people on the panel believed 

but you were saying what you think 

is is I I I feel like you're trying to pin me down and[- 

  [if it's not 
what you believe just say I don't believe that 

what part wouldn't I believe 

well you tell me which part you don't believe
there's the sentence 
which part would you now say you don't believe 

I believe that 25 year old women perhaps have had 
because they've been alive longer maybe have had more partners 
but I don't believe that makes them a bad person 

right but you understand that the way you phrased it 
makes every 25 year old woman[= 

         [I I understand-

=feel a bad person 

I no I don't think so I [(…)-

 [of course you do 
not stupid An- come on

Piers 

Andrew you're not stupid you know 
what that sounds like to any 25 26 year old woman 

completely and [you're- 

    [right so you have maligned 
every 25 26 year old woman with that statement 
and I'm simply asking you to all those who are not 
of the type of women that you've described it 
are you sorry 

I don't want anybody to be offended by anything I say 
I want to be a positive force in the world 
I don't want anybody to hear what I say 
and it make them feel bad about themselves[=

      [mm.
 
=I want all people to live righteous and good 
whether they're male or female 
and anybody who’s [offe-
   							       
   	[do you lead a righteous life?

Piers Andrew
but there was also I think quite a disturbing piece 
that BuzzFeed did and it talked about the the 
negative impact of young impressionable male minds 
when they've read or seen 
some of the more inflammatory things you've said 
and they quoted for example 
Sandy uh 22 from Washington 
my father's gone from a man 
who minored in women's studies in college 
he was kind and in touch with his emotions 
treated all people men and women around him with kindness 
to a man who says that whenever he sees an effeminate male stranger
he gets an overwhelming urge to murder them 
he loves podcasts he listens a lot of podcasts 
I know he's listened to Andrew Tate 

woah woah woah let's stop for a second 
let's be professional here Piers because you're a professional [as am I. 

      									 [yeah. 

firstly she said 
did you say that my father went 
she said my father [has gone? 

          [her father. 

that's a full-grown man= 

=mhhm=

=firstly so we're talking about my impact on children 
you just talked about a full-grown man here 
secondly I’ve never talked about murdering effeminate men 
in anything online ever 
on in any context ever 
so I don't know why they have taken 
some random person I’ve never met in the world 
who's full grown an adult 
and come to their own conclusions who I’ve never met 
and lumped his name in with mine 
that is absolutely unfair on every level
I didn't watch I didn't read [this BuzzFeed=

          [what is your view-

=I didn't read this BuzzFeed article=

=hmm=

=but after hearing the first point 
I know it's trash that is complete garbage 
[to sit and say that I’m the reason= 

[what is y- what is your view-

=this man believes what he believes
[(… disgusting).

[I have seen a quote from you 
and you can tell me what you feel here about this=

=sure=

=you talk about people don't want to see men dressed up in 
dress i.e. transgender [people.

    [that's not exactly what I said 
[I said=

[what did- what did you say. 

=I said the reason I am so popular and I'm so famous
is that there's a large contingent of men 
who don't want to wear makeup 
who still want to make money 
go to the gym be strong drive a fast car 
be traditionally masculine and don't want to be shamed for that 
and they don't want to be called toxic for that 
that is the reason I'm so massively famous 
that is what [I said. 

          [what do you think of transgender people 

that's nothing to do with me 
I'm not transgender and I don't understand the issue like they do 
[they can do whatever they-

[are- are you transphobic do you- are you- 
do you consider yourself that 

transphob- wha- af- afraid? 

uhhh well it kind of yeah I- y- you [have a phobia-

          [I don't live in fear my friend 
I- I- n- I have no [prob-

    [do you have a dislike of transgender people 

I don't know any transgender people 

but do you have a dislike of what they stand for what they are 

no why would I I-

I don't know [I’m asking.

           [that's not my issue that's not my issue 
and that's actually quite interesting because 
when I was attacked a lot of these stupid articles like BuzzFeed
because it's ridiculous that whole 
that first point proves anyone with a brain knows that that's garbage=

=mm= 

=when they attacked me 
they lump a whole bunch of things in together 
they say misogynistic racist transphobic 
they just put them all together at [random= 

           [nooo I don’t-

=I’m mixed race[= 

    [by the way- 

=I I don't know where they get these 
they just get these buzzwords [and put them in a sentence. 

				      [Andrew Andrew by the way
I completely agree [and I’ve had=

	                      [it's crazy.

=and I’ve had the same thing done to me[= 

[okay well there you go then.

=and I'm not calling you anything 
I'm asking you what you personally believe you are

I it's not an issue I discuss 
what I do discuss is [that- 

[so you support transgender people?

pe- tran I I support individual liberty I'm a libertarian 

yeah so you support transgender people 

sure sure why not 

exactly yeah 

so but my point is as a whole you're saying that I'm saying 
I don't want to see men in dresses I'm saying no 
[I’m saying that-

[do you support gay people? 

sure [I- I'm- I’m saying there's a=

         [yeah.

=large contingent of men in the world 
who like the idea of the traditional masculine view of the world 
who feel happy when they watch 80s action heroes 
with big muscles and they [run around=

				[yeah. 

=and there's nothing toxically masculine about having a fast car 
and a beautiful girlfriend 
and making a bunch of money and [being th= 

  [nothing at all? 

=absolutely and those are the people who are my fans
[and I’m s- and I’m saying-

[I agree but actually- but the problem is 
okay I'm going to interrupt you [just to say this- no no-

				      [ts- ha- okay
okay but this you're saying that I have a problem with p- 
men in dresses I'm saying no 
the people who watch my [content- 

          [I’ve asked you that question you've answered

yeah but the people who watch my content
don't want to see men in dresses 
clearly I don't wear a dress 
that’s the [point I’m making.

      [that’s not why they're watching your content 
[because you're not wearing a dress. 

[no no but that's the point I'm making 
that's the point I was making 
there's a large contingent of men 
who are not interested in the things that's perhaps 
the YouTube algorithms trying to feed 
[them, they find my content.

[I think there are lots of- I I I look 
when you support masculinity and masculine traits 
I'm with you [right. 

          [okay so you
agree a man should protect and provide for a woman 

I- absolutely 

okay so you agree if you're walking down the street 
with a woman you'd be prov-
you'd be responsible with her safety 

uh yeah 

cool absolutely so if that woman wanted to 
walk alone at [night then they-

[I don't think I have authority 
over the woman [as you we do that.

		      [all right.
okay so let me ask you another question Piers 
because we are professionals 
let's say your woman decided she wanted to take a nice 
little walk through the south side of Chicago at 2 A.M 
and she wanted you to go with her and 
you were responsible for fighting and dying on the spot 
if she was attacked= 

=mm=

=don't you think you would say to her 
no we're not going out right now it's not safe 

yes 

okay so you'd have authority to make the decisions 
[so we agree.

[no I wouldn't
[I would say I don't think you should=

[so we make- so we agree.

= if she decides to it's her own volition 

w- w- well if she decides 
you're not going to stop [her.

                        [I have no power to stop her 

completely

but you think you do 

no I don't think I have power to [stop her= 

       [well you clearly do

=no I think I have power to make the decision 
I think no that's not [sensible- 

           [so if you have the power to make a decision 
you have the power to stop her 

uh no [because it she- 

[and that's where we differ 
and that's why I think it's really interesting about you 
I don't think you really think through what you're saying 

I think through what I'm [saying so carefully Piers-

      [because what-
yeah but Andrew you've literally just said 
is that you have the power to stop her 

no I said I don't have the power to stop her 
I'm not going to lock her in the room 
I'm saying that [as a-

  [so if she wants to go on her own 

then she's going to go [but as a c- 

    [then you don’t have authority to stop her. 

okay but as a couple 
if we're going to sit there and decide 
if we're going to take this [date-

          [you (asked if I’d rather)- sh- would I 
feel a sense of responsibility for her safety 
absolutely [absolutely= 

       [agreed so so let me finish Piers-

=would I have the power or authority 
to stop her doing it no 

no of course not so let me finish Piers 
you're not going to stop her walking out the hotel 
of course it's her decision she's a sovereign individual=

=mm=
 
=my point is that usually in a couple 
people have you'd sit there as a team and you discuss 
and perhaps on certain issues
the woman will know more about X and she'll decide X 
and the man might know more about Y and he'll [decide Y= 

 [hmm.

=so I'm saying if we're as a couple 
and we're sitting there and deciding as a couple as a team 
and she says she wants to take this late night stroll 
I'm going to say you know what I'm going to veto this one 
I'm going to call [veto on this one= 

    [but do you believe- 

=‘cause it’s dangerous [which to a degree= 

			     [right

=would give me in that particular scenario 
a degree of authority
if she said I don't want to listen to you [Andrew I=

                    [it doesn't give you authority 

=if she says I don't want to listen to you Andrew
I want to go on that walk 
then what can I do 
say well then [I- I hope-

            [then you don’t have authority 

uh- then I hope- I wish you the best [my love. 

   [but y- then you
don't have authority 

cool then it's a semantic argument 

not really

I think it [is.

   [it's the complete opposite of 
what you said you had which was authority 

no problem Piers no problem 
but I think I think [we actually- 

      [let me ask you about
what what do you believe about depression 
do you believe depression is a real thing 

I believe that feeling depressed is real 
I don't believe depression as a clinical disease is real no 

really 

correct you don't believe people can be clinically depressed 

I think PTSD is very real I’ve unfortunately 
I have some friends who suffer from that=

=mm=

=I know that feeling depressed is real 
I believe that the number one power you have against these things 
are taking c- trying to take control of your own mind 
and affecting your own life 
I believe that it's not healthy to hand over all your power 
and believe that depression is an outside disease 
that you can't affect 
I know that when I’ve had difficult periods in my life 
and also many of my friends like I’ve said 
suffer from PTSD and been through terrible things 
I’ve lived a very difficult life and I know people who have 
that the things that made them feel better 
is when they woke up and said you know what 
I'm not going to allow this to damage me anymore 
I'm going to take responsibility 
I'm going to get up and I'm going to fight this as hard [as I can-

          [right and I’m-
and by the way on that I agree [right= 

      [so we agree. 

=my favorite speech is the Rocky Balboa [one (to his son).

 [okay so then we agree
the [way- wha- no we do. 

       [no no here’s where we don't agree 

uhhhh Piers- 

you don't- now hang on 
you- you've got to let me [interject when I don't agree with you [right. 

        [sure.				     	  [sure. 

where I don't agree with you 
is that there's no such thing as clinical depression 
there absolutely is[= 

        [well-

=it's a proven scientific medical reality 
there's a different argument about have we gone a bit too soft right 
[in schools and [all the rest of it absolutely[=
 
[yeah.		    [yeah.			   [yeah. 

=do I think some people moan and whine 
too much about their lot in life definitely[= 

           [okay. 

=are we a victimhood society 100 percent[=

               [okay. 

=is there such a thing as clinical depression absolutely[=

            [so if some- 

=and if- and my argument is 
that if you actually bracket everybody who's not clinically depressed 
and doesn't have the genuine medical condition 
then actually if millions of people are deemed to have depression 
the ones who really need the help don't get it[=

       [well that- 

=that's my point 

well that can that that I would agree with you're right 
I think it's certainly a overused term 

yeah but you don’t think- 
you don’t accept there is such a thing as clinical depression 

no I don't [‘cause- 

      [and that to me is a damaging view 

okay well let me explain why 
if someone comes to me and says I'm clinically depressed 
or I feel very very sad 
I would say the first thing you need to do 
is stop accepting the identity of a clinically depressed person 
stop accepting you have no control over this 
and what you need to do is stop identifying that way 
and let's work together to try and fight against [it. 

         [but there isn’t 
an eminent doctor in the world 
who would tell you there is no such thing 
as clinical [depression= 

    	      [I think Johann-

=who would not tell you [that some people=

       [I think I think Johann- 

=it’s simply beyond [their control.

          [I think Johann Hari wrote a book 
saying exactly that my friend 

he- but he's not an eminent doctor 

no but he [I s- 

     [he’s a journalist.

I said depression wasn't real long ago and was attacked for it 
then Johann Hari wr- wr- wrote a book 
[which is actually-

[what’s it got to do with Johann Hari?

because he wrote a book proving me right 
most people[- 
          
           [Johann Hari is a journalist. 

sure and and my point is that a lot of people who are clinically depressed
are suffering with something in their life 
and if you fix the problem in their life 
perhaps they won't feel depressed [anymore=

 [yeah but-
 
=it's not a disease. 

yeah but Andrew [you're not- 

      [that’s situational. 

Andrew you're simply wrong 

if that's what you believe Piers it’s [fine.

 [it’s not what I believe

I don't believe in things that 
take power away [from me. 

       [there is not an eminent doctor 
in the world [that would agree with you[=

          [Piers-			        [Piers I-

=if you I think you know more than [doctors .

              [I can't become 
clinically depressed 

how do you know 

because I don't believe in it 
I can't be haunted by a ghost if I don't believe in ghosts 

well that’s like saying I'm never going to die because I don't believe in it 
it's ridiculous 

perhaps

but if it allows me to live a life 
where I feel happy [at- within myself-

          [but here’s where you- see this is
again this is that little area [where you lose me. 

            [it’s-			
no I don't lose you [because-

                     [you are because- 
[as somebody with your [following says there’s no such thing- 

[Piers-			       [Piers the thousands of people- 
the thousands of people who have emailed me 
saying my doctor told me I was clinically depressed 
and it's a disease that I have got in my brain 
and I can't be fixed 
and I started listening to you 
and I realized that that's not the case 
and I can fix my own life 
and you're the only person who [has ever helped me[= 

				        [if you’ve-	       [oh Andrew-

=thousands of people [have emailed me that exact email.

   [Andrew if you think-
if you think you are single-handedly curing people 
of clinical depression you are living in cloud cuckoo land 

I am reading the emails of people 
who I have cured of clinical depression

you're reading emails from people who have believed you
when you say there isn't such a thing 
and they've probably never been diagnosed clinical depressed 
they just want to go along with what Andrew Tate says 

I don't think so I [think-

     [and I think your view of that is 
that view is dangerous 

I I I respect that you think my view is dangerous 
and I respect you have the right to view that [to you think that= 

      [hmm.

I think that clinical depression 
I actually agree with you is massively over diagnosed 
I’ve already said that PTSD is a very real thing 
I’ve already said[- 

   [I didn't no hang on 

okay 

again you misquoted me 
I I did not say clinical depression is massively over diagnosed 
I said that people who claim to be depressed 
but don't have clinical depression 
I think that is massively overblown right 
in other words there are a lot of people who just have a bad day=

=yeah= 

=and declare I’ve got depression= 

=yeah= 

=and I I say well have you been to a doctor 
have you been clinically diagnosed 
if you have and you have clinical depression that's one thing 
but if you haven't we could probably work on some mental strength 
and resilience skills with you 
but a a clinically depressed person 
has a an absolutely proven medical condition 
that is beyond their control 

not according to me and many others my friend 

well look what do you know about it honestly 

I know I know [fr-

		 [you’re not a doctor are you
you're not trained are you

I’m not a [doctor.

     [you’re not a psychiatrist you're 
none of those things=

=sure= 

=you're a guy on the make he's done very well for himself 
spouting stuff off 
much of which I agree with as you've seen in the interview uh 
but some of which is ludicrous and that's one of them 

it's not ludicrous 

it is 

it's not [my friend.

  [if you said to me 
we're in a victimhood society it’s got to stop 
I'm with you=

=okay= 

=but the moment you try and deny clinical depression 

I believe feeling depressed [is real=

				 [mm.

=I do not believe it's a disease that you catch from the sky 
and you cannot affect 
I believe that no matter what happens 
I believe you have control over your own mind 
and you can fight against it 
I believe if you change your circumstances in your life 
you may feel different 
I'll give you a quick example 
I had a guy who emailed me saying he was clinically depressed 
and he was going to kill himself 
I obviously am not a psychiatrist I'm not a doctor 
I told him because I reply to my emails 
I said have you been to a psychiatrist 
he said yes I'm clinically depressed I’ve been on these pills 
this amount of time I'm on antidepressants it doesn't work 
I said I don't know what to say to besides this 
and he s- he said he lost his girlfriend
that's why he became clinically depressed so I said listen 
go to the gym get a six-pack first 
once you've got six-pack email me again
if you still feel like killing yourself 
I don't know what else to say to you but I'd say 
strong body is a strong mind 
go train 
he went he started sending me progress pictures 
emailing me him getting in better better shape 
and eventually got a six-pack 
he's now a professional bodybuilder 
and he said I can't believe I was considering that 
I feel so much better etc 
the doctor was telling him he was clinically depressed and couldn't cure it 
he started taking control of his own life 
and now he felt better[=

  [have you seen-

=now I'm not saying it's the case for everybody[=

          [no no- 

I'm just saying [I- I’m just-

  [here’s my question though
have you seen the guy's medical records 

of course not I just told you the story 

so you’re just taking his word for it 

oh I am taking the words of a man 
who emailed me with a bunch of medication 
and specific [doses- 

           [so you’re denying proven science 
because one guy writes to you who you help 
and you've not seen any evidence 
he ever had clinical depression diagnosed 

I'm denying the idea that [if you’re-

         [and on the back of it 
you go on your your y’know rants in public 
to tens of millions of people denying something 
because this guy writes to you and says he had it and you cured him 
and I think that's a dangerous mindset Andrew=

=that's fine= 

=and that's where you don't have a responsible view 
of your [influence over people. 

  [disa- disagree it's very responsible 
because I'm saving people's lives 
I disagree that if you're dy- if you have- if you feel depressed 
I disagree that you cannot affect it and change your life 
and take control and fix yourself and feel happier 
I disagree with [that=

               [d’you think d’you think co-

=I I ref- I refuse to accept that there are people out there 
who cannot become happy contented individuals 
I refuse to accept 
we live in a world where God has created people 
who no matter how hard they work 
and how good their life becomes can't be happy 
I don't accept that I accept that the universe is a very giving place 
and that God loves all of us and if you try your best 
and you work hard you can become a better person 
and I also will argue with you 
and I'll counter the point that you sitting here on your platform 
telling people they have clinical depression 
there's nothing they can do about it 
is far [more dangerous-

          [I didn’t say that

okay well then if they have [clinical depression-

[why do you mis- why do you misquote me

no because you're [saying- 

 		         [you hate being misquoted

no you're saying if people have clinical depression 
[that they- that they have a disease.

[I never said there’s nothing they can do about it 
they go to a doctor and they get diagnosed[=

    [cool. 

=and they get help 

then I would argue the point that somebody[- 

      [it’s the complete
opposite of what you just said I said 

I would argue the point that if somebody has depression of any kind 
whether it's clinical whether it exists or not 
whether they feel depressed or not whatever 
that taking control of their life 
taking personal responsibility and working hard 
is always going to be the positive 
best thing they can possibly do for their life going forward
[and the people going around them=

[how positive is it- how-

=so sitting here saying I don't believe in clinical depression 
you don't believe in depression 
no I don't I believe that people can take control 
and fight against things[=

     			      [right. 

=I believe in personal sovereignty

right fine 

good so we agree 

no we don’t 

yes we do 

no we don’t 
[(you know…)-

[Piers you’re on my side 
you’re afraid of being canceled along with me 

I [I said to you from the start=

  [we’re just- we’re- that’s all it is.

=I agree with a lot of what you say 

completely so [we’re talking about- 

  [I but I'm taking you to task 
over the stuff I don't agree with=

=sure= 

=and I'm just not sure you understand why it's wrong[= 

         [no-

=which is in itself quite revealing

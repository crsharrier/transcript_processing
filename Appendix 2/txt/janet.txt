Piers Janet
so Janet I got you back on the show because
cards on the table I have spent an infuriating 24 hours
and I want you to explain why I’ve had to go through this because 
let me start from this premise 
I have always been 100\% supportive of all gay rights
gay marriage rights transgender rights
in fact, I want equality for everyone
in America and around the world.
that's always been my position
anyone that watches this show
knows that's exactly what I’ve always stood for
I had you on the show 
I uh you had- you wrote a powerful book.
I did nothing but laud your courage
I said you were a fantastic person to be out there centre-stage
selling the message that there's 
no need to stigmatize transgender people
I called you a woman throughout the interview
I never disputed the fact that you're a woman
and yet today I have spent literally 12 hours 
being viciously abused by the transgender community
egged on by your own tweeting last night
that you were somehow
very dismayed by the way the interview had gone
now, I was surprised because 
you never said anything during the interview to indicate
you were remotely dismayed with any of the terminology I was using
at the end of the interview you were very cordial we shook hands
you thanked me for the interview
and off you went 
and the interview was done 5 days ago
so I ask you Janet Mock to explain to me 
why you didn't say anything during the interview
why you seemed quite happy with it afterwards
why you then felt the need to tweet quite hostile tweets in my direction 
which then sparked this furore among the transgender community
because I feel pretty peeved about it

 well, I’m sorry that you feel offended
I think that people in the trans community feel equally as offended
I think one of the number one things with trans women specifically is that
so much of our lives are open to dissection 
and illegitimacy and investigation
and we're constantly questioned ever since we're very young 
that who we are is incorrect wrong and should be kept secret
and I think that being someone that is very visible 
in a stigmatized community you know I am a trans woman of colour
I’m a young woman and 
these are issues that we need to give trans people space 
to tell their own stories 
and we should follow the lead of people who um 
are out there and being visible and actually advocating for these rights

but that's w-exactly why I had you on the show
that’s why I promoted your book
that’s why I told everybody to go and read the damn thing
so I ask you again why have I been vilified 
for being transparently supportive of you
I don't get it 

maybe you don't get it because you're not a trans woman
trans [women are-

           [well explain to me [explain to me what I did wrong=

			         [I am- 

=what did I do wrong

you called m- uh 
so before commercial break
we had a lovely conversation and then all of a sudden you said
who was formerly a man
I was a baby
I was assigned male gender because of the appearance of my genitals
as I grew up I discovered my girlhood 
I discovered my womanhood
and I proclaimed and defined myself for myself as Audrey Lord says
if we do not define [ourselves for-
 
         [why didn't you correct me at the time
why didn’t you correct me?

 I did not because I [was scared.
 
          [if you felt that strongly

 I did not [because I was scared.

    [scared of what

and I wanted to be [a cordial guest=

                                  [scared of what

and I think that was probably incorrect of me
I wanted to be kind I wanted to be generous because
I was appreciative of having two segments on a mainstream show
it was my first major appearance as a young trans woman 
who wrote her [first book.

   [and I thought you were terrific by the way 
[for wh- for what it’s worth I thought you were terrific-

[and I thought it was a terrific exchange too 
I think that [I loved that you called me=

        [uh by the way- by the way Janet-

=that I look like Beyonce
that you said [all these amazing things and that was great=

[right I I honestly-

=but I think that also being offensive and being kind 
are not mutually exclusive things
I think that we can completely have great intentions 
and be good people but also be ignorant
and have a lack of understanding about these issues
and a lot of these things especially for trans women 
are about [understanding it’s about understanding and=

     [right ok let- let me- alright- alright- Janet- let me cut-

=intention is is great but we also need [action.

         [uh
let me cut to the quick about why perhaps confusion has arisen
not just in my mind but in many people's minds
you are famous in America now
predominantly from a piece you wrote 
for Marie Claire magazine in 2011
[I’ve got that piece in front of-

[I actually did not write that piece
I [didn’t write that piece.

 [well it’s in your words
it's it's a first person piece by you
[right (you’re not gonna) dispute that.

[I didn't choose the title
just like I did not choose the title on the title 
cards that were underneath my name in the segment 
or the tweets that went [out from the show.
 			 
      [okay.
okay I don't want this to be 
I don't want this to be a hostile encounter
[I really don’t because I still actually greatly admire you=

[I don't either, mhmm.

=and I just want to make that clear[=

 [I appreciate that.

=however this is the piece that I’ve got in front of me
it was the piece that made you famous
[the headline is I was born a boy[=

[mhmm.			         [mhmm.

=right now 
maybe you didn't write the headline so I read the piece
okay you talk about going through gender reassignment surgery
a sex change
though I had been born a boy to my native Hawaiian mother 
that’s the first page uh
the next day there were only dolls okay for me a boy to play with
and then another reference here on the last page 
something about my past (I need to share with you) 
(this is in) the conversation with Aaron who's your boyfriend
I calmly said I was born a boy
so I can kind of give you that you weren't writing the headlines but 
do you really expect me to believe that in a piece you wr-
you are personally signed off on that made you famous 
in which you repeatedly call yourself a boy
[even at the moment-

[I actually did not write that piece Piers
I also wrote a follow up piece and essay critiquing that 
just like I critiqued [this episode=

 		        [I read that I read that I read that but ok-

=and so in the book I also
in the introduction of my book 
I talk about how that piece was so problematic
and it's problematic because 
we don't let trans women say who they are
we need to just follow trans women 
and let them say who they are 
and believe them when they say that
that’s what this is about
this is not about Twitter that's why I was not engaging today 
I was not engaging in the debate
I continued to move forward
[and tried to continue to make this a positive experience=

[yeah-		okay-

=and I want this to be a learning [experience=

				          [right-

=I [want allies I want allies like you and supporters like you to continue=

     [explain to me- I want to learn too. I want to learn too
 
=to support [us and to continue to give us space on your show=

	         [okay.                                  right!
 
 =I don't want other people to be afraid and these are touchy issues
and they've been around [since the 1950s.

         [Janet let me say something
I do support you
I couldn't have made that any more crystal clear yesterday
I continue to support you 
I’ve always been supportive of all gay rights
gay marriage rights, [equality, transgender rights-
 
            [gay rights are not trans rights
[gay rights are not transgender rights.
 
[I s-just sa- tr-

[it’s true.

[I just came to tra- 
I was about to say transgender
I was halfway [through the words.
 
  [but it has nothing to do 
with [gay rights. 

         [don’t interrupt me

gay rights and trans [rights are not the same things.

			[I’m talking about-
I didn't say they were
I didn't say they were
I’m simply saying I believe in equality for all 
whether you're gay, transgender, whatever
I don't care right
I’ve always been completely supportive[=

         [I think that's great.

=and when I read a piece
when I read a piece in Marie Claire a prestigious magazine
you spent a lot of time posing for pictures with them
with the journalist 
a lot of time in her presence
she also appears after all this time she spent with you this journalist 
to be labouring under the massive misapprehension 
that you have repeatedly referred to yourself as having been a boy
who then went through gender reassignment surgery 
and became a woman
now, that is perhaps where the confusion lay
because that's the original piece that sparked 
the attention about [you so- so let me ask this-

           [that piece should not have
been the basis of our interview though Piers
I wrote the record of my life
I wrote it
I took me three years to write that
it took me years to be the first person in my family to go to college
to be able to have access to those resources 
and to write this book 
and to live my life and my entire life 
I’ve been told that who I am is wrong and should be kept silent
and so for me that Marie Claire piece is not the basis of my life
my life is in redefining realness this book that is a gift
not for me
it's a gift to young girls like me growing up 
so [that they know that who they are is real and legitimate= 

     [I- I get it-

=and that they're valuable and worthy 
[of protection and care.

[Janet, I don't dispute- 
but Janet we have a
we have a moment there of absolute agreement
I don't dispute anything that you've just said
I simply ask that if I’m being vilified for repeating something that has
from the very start of your media uh profile if you like 
has [been apparent accepted-
        
        [which I critiqued 
in the opening [of my book=
		
   [I I g-  you've made that very clear but-

=ten pages in I critiqued that [piece.
 
    [here is- here is my point
why is it s- explain to me
let me learn [something here=

	          [mhm.

=explain to me why it is so offensive for somebody like you
who grew up a boy until you were into your teenage years 
and w- and your family treated you as a boy 
and you were biologically a boy 
that you then have gender reassignment surgery 
and you become a woman 
and you've always felt you're a woman
and as I said right off the top last night 
you have always felt inside you that you were a female
and I did not dispute that at all
and I don't dispute it to you now
(I mean) I have absolute respect for you believing 
that has always been your gender
but I also believe that the the phrase gender reassignment
means that you had a sex change operation
it means that you go from male to female or female to male
that is the legal definition of gender reassignment
so [I need to learn-
 
     [I think that gender is a lot 
more [complex, there’s a lot more nuance than that.

[well l- well let me ask you the question
let me ask you the question
let me ask you the question
the question is here's where I want to learn
because I don't want this to be [an ongoing issue that I have=

      [mhm.

=with with the community of which 
you are such a great spokesman and advocate
I want to learn why it is so offensive 
to actually just say that you grew up as a boy 
and you then because you've always felt that you were female
you had surgery to become a woman 
to become a real woman as you say in the book
why is it offensive?

I think that we need to have a discussion about what gender is
and gender expectations in our culture
I think that we are born and we are assigned a sex at birth
that is a matter none of us have control over
but we do have control over our destinies 
and over our identities
we should be respected
it’s not about the past
it's not about what surgeries I may or may not have had
it’s not about how I disclose my gender to people
it's about who I am right now
I’m Janet Mock, author of redefining realness 
and I’m a fierce trans advocate
and I will continue to be exactly that
that's what I was on this show to do
if I spoke out every single time that someone said 
called me out of my name or labelled me as something that I’m not 
I would not have time to advocate 
for the fierce and urgent issues in my community
issues of poverty and joblessness
of a lack of healthcare 
of violence verbal and physical violence against trans women

how does it help you Janet
that somebody like me 
who has been such an open supporter 
of the community that you represent so well and so publicly 
that you target me for what you knew would be 
a load of abuse that then followed
you did the Tweets last night 
ignited a firestorm of abuse and vilification my way
because you said I had sensationalized your story
uh I was not formerly a man I wasn’t formerly a boy
was another Tweet you said
uh all this kind of [rhetoric that you produced-

       [I sent three tweets

and you- and yet- yet-
yeah but Janet they were important tweets to me
and important [Tweets to what I believe-

   [and I did not tweet them at you 
I tweeted them at the framework of your show 
and how they were packaging [this story that we did=

     [right-

=our exchange was completely fine
but when you package something with the headline 
until 18 was a boy  
and also say formerly a man 
when in talk about my beloved the love of my life 
and our interaction together 
that is false advertising and that is infotainment
because I understand as someone [who worked in media=
 
  [what is false about the-

=who worked [who worked at people magazine= 

[but but but but Janet-

=who worked as an [editor I understand that=

[Janet it’s not-

=sensationalizing [our stories entices people to look in=

		        [it’s not false advertising

=but I hope that [the best thing that we can get out of it=

    [no Janet Janet with the greatest of res-

=is to be a learning and teaching moment for all of us

Janet with the greatest of respect
and I mean with the greatest of respect
you've written a book redefining realness, my path to womanhood
my path to womanhood, identity love and so much more right
I’ve got the Marie Claire article that started your whole media profile
I was born a boy repeatedly in your words saying 
[I was born a boy-

[I did not write that piece it’s not my [words=

					    [right-

[words are precious to me I’m a writer=

[so let me ask you a si- let me ask you a-

=[words are precious and I I really believe that we need to give people-

 [let me ask you a simple question!

I would like to ask you a question

[okay can I ask mine first and then you can ask yours=

[w- w- hhhhhhh okay.

=okay 
my question is simply this
do you dispute that you were born a boy

do I dispute that I was born a boy
I was born a baby who was assigned male at birth
I did not identify or live my life as a boy 
as soon [as I had enough agency in my life=

  [okay.

=to grow up I became who I am
and this did not start at 18 when I went to Thailand to have surgery
it started when I was six years old 
and my parents saw me for who I was and allowed me to live my life
that's a lot of [nuance=

[okay-

=and it's hard to communicate
that in 30 seconds or even in a 140 character tweet
that's why I’m here right now
I want this to be a learning and teaching moment for all of us
‘cause there's a lot of misunderstanding
just as much as you were vilified 
as you say from my s- from my supporters
that's actually my community who are vilified every single day 
and misunderstood and drove into isolation 
and told that what- who they are is incorrect and wrong 
and should be under investigation
and my [question to you is=

               [but Janet- but Janet- Janet-

=will you please use your platform to
continue to tell our stories 
and to let us[-
 
           [yes!

well [there you go that’s-

         [yes as I always have done

yes [and I would love to have coffee=
   
       [but let me- let me- let me-

=with you and sit down and have a
real [conversation off air and really=

        [I- I’m sure we- 			   

=[evolve and have transcendence and understand one another.
  
   [I’m sure we will do that
and I would be happy to do that
right but let me jump in 
I have never said that you were wrong
or anyone through a transgender process is wrong 
or was somehow in the wrong place or wrong body (or whatever)
I’ve never used that kind of terminology
I would see that as being obviously offensive
I I don't see that as being wrong that you were born a boy and
and felt you were woman and are now a woman 
I don't feel that I (don’t think that) any of that is wrong
and I don't think the terminology is offensive
and I think my complaint about what you did with those tweets
is that A, you never raised any of this during the interview 
where I repeatedly referred to you as having been male before
you never picked me up on it or showed any sign of irritation
and I think that I just felt that you threw me to the wolves at bit
and by the way, I don't mind I’m a big boy I can take it
I can take being vilified by anybody
I don't mind being vilified
I get it every day from people 
who support the lack of gun control in America, right
however, however, I do think it was a little unfair 
that you sparked off this firestorm of abuse to me 
when I am a supporter of your community 
and always have been 
and I think it doesn't do you or your community any good service
to try and make people like me the enemy 
and the target of abuse
and you've read the tweets 
you know what I’m talking about
when actually I’m on [your side.

 			 [I actually couldn’t read the tweets
I could not read any of the tweets
my life today and the lives of trans people 
continue to have been more and more miseducated 
and misinformed within these tweets
um and I think it's bigger than Twitter
and I think it’s bigger than this book
this is a conversation I think
our country is going through 
well my country 
is going through a lot in terms of our culture on trans issues 
and how then do we report on these lives without sensationalizing
without enticing 
without warping and throwing definitions and labels on people 
who have the capacity and the know how and the experience to 
claim their lives and I think our exchange was good
you know you compared me to Beyonce and I live for her
but it was also bad in the sense that it further showed 
other people in my community that if Janet Mock can be misgendered 
if she can be labelled something that she is not 
then how- what does that mean for me?
And I- I’m only out here doing this work 
for these girls that grew up like I did
I wanted to give them a story that reflects them 
a story [that is sensitive and full of nuance and love.
 	  
  	  [okay.

okay Janet I get it
my advice to you in return would be
[next time you do an interview-

[I don't need advice 
I don't need advice but [I will take guidance.
 
     [you've just given me advice
you've just given me advice I perhaps also don't feel I need
but I’ve taken it in good grace 
so let me give you some advice
next time you're doing a big high profile television interviewer 
and you feel the interviewer is miscategorising your identity or your gender
my advice and I say this in a nice uh friendly respectful way
is say something
don't pretend it's all gone very well 
and shake that interviewer's hand afterwards and thank him
and then go off five days later and ignite a social media 
firestorm of abuse in his direction
because that isn't fair, either
so I don't try and equate my struggle in life with yours
I’ve had it pretty easy by comparison
your book remains a great inspiring book
I remain a great supporter of the transgender community
I hope we can both move on from this
and I appreciate you coming back on the show tonight
thank you

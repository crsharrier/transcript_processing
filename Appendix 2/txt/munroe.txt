Piers Munroe
you must have known
when you wrote your very public [facebook post=

         [uhuh.

=just how sensitive [those words were going to be um= 

           [uhuh.

=i don't have the energy to talk about
the racial violence of white people[=

             [mhmm.

=um most of you refuse to acknowledge 
your existence privilege and success as a race is built 
on the backs blood and death of people of color[=

  [mhmm.

=um do you think that all white people are racist

i don't think that all white people are by nature racist 
um from conception to birth 
i think that  we are all the same um 
but we need to speak about how we're socialized as a people
and er my resp- my um post was based on socialization 
and racism as a structure
um I think as a society we’re just taught certain things 
we're taught that men are superior to women 
we're taught that women are meant to be submissive 
we're told that gay people are meant to be ashamed of their sexuality 
but it doesn't mean that this is how things need to be 

do you think all people
all white people are responsible for that 
or [believe that or? 

    [um I don't think that all white people believe it no 
i think that there is cases um 
well I mean there's loads of allies I mean
you don't need to think this way 
and it takes actively dismantling racism to be an ally
because if you're not doing anything then how are you helping racism 

so you s- you said uh when you explained about this 
you said white people are racist due to socialization 
in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist[=

        [uhuh.

=and heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic so[=

									  [yes.
 
=I’m a white straight male guy[=

    [it’s not about you though- 

=so basically I’m like I’m like enemy number one[=

[no 

=so I’m a racist sexist homophobe 
by your [logic. 

  [well yeah sexist yes but I [wouldn’t- 
 
            [I’m not sexist

some of the things [you say (…)-

          [and I’m not racist 
and I’m not a homophobe 
so who are you with the greatest of respect to you
who are you to say that every 
straight white guy [in the world is a-

		        [I did not say that.

well you did you said white people are racist 
due [to socialization=

       [I just-

=in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist 
heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic
you are calling straight white guys like me
a series of offensive stereotypical labels 
[which I find I find very offensive. 

[and this is where there’s a problem-
okay this is why there's a problem 
because you're taking it [personally.

       [there is a problem 
I am taking it personally
[yes.

[it isn’t about [you though Piers.

[when you say all white people are racist
as a white person [i find that offensive. 

        [please let me speak 
please let me speak instead of speaking over me 

the floor is yours 

okay so basically instead of taking it personally 
please think about how to be part of the solution 
[rather than the problem. 

[why don’t you think about being part of the solution 

I am part of the [solution. 

    [you're not 
you're causing more division[= 

   [I’m not causing more division

=you you're basically causing more division[=

						     [Piers, by speaking about-
 
=by- by [telling all white people they’re racist.

	 [Piers please let me speak Piers let me speak
by talking about racism is not causing a divide 
there's a divide anyway
we need to be speaking about what the s-
what the root of racism what the root of sexism is
and sexism doesn't come from women 
so of course it's caused by men
this is a social [contract. 

  [you don't think women can be sexist 

i don't think that women can enforce uh [misogyny like- 

           [what a load of nonsense. 

no because it's all[- 

       [you don't think any women 
can be [sexist.

 [women don't uphold the patriarchy Piers 
that is [not the case.

[uphold the what

the [patriarchy.

      [what’s that

you don't know what the [patriarchy is? 

       [i do but explain it

the patriarchy is basically a structure that puts men at the top of power=

=mm=

=so [it’s it’s not women that enforce the patriarchy=

       [the five most- the five-

=[’cause women don’t have anything to err-

   [the five most powerf-   the five most 
powerful people in this country currently are women
how does that how does that sit with your patriarchy
[they are.

[so you're saying that the patriarchy doesn't exist 

I’m saying the five most powerful people in britain are women
so this idea that men still rule the entire planet
[and are these evil creatures to be removed from power=

[so you’re sayng that the patriarchy doesn’t exist

=[doesn’t really stack up with the facts.
 
 [you can say that the patriarchy doesn’t exist Piers 
but the patriarchy exists [it’s a fact.

        [my- my point about this is 
there are of course there are serious 
debates to be had about racism
but my god the world has moved and moved fast
[from where it used to be I don’t-

[Piers you are part of the problem [if you think this=

					[I’m not part of the problem.

=you are part of the problem Piers 
because you are denying my lived experience
[I spoke-

[what d’you mean I’m d- what d’y- what what d’you mean I’m deny-
I’m not denying [you anything!

    [you’re speaking over me for one

well no now you're playing your old trick of being the victim 
and you played that very- you
you immediately came out after you were fired 
with all the stuff about all the insults you've had and so on and so on
of course you're going to get insulted 
I don't agree with the way they've insulted you
but when you call every white person racist
[and say we’re all- 

[Piers my mother’s wor- my moth- my mother’s words.

fine well when you say 
i don't have the energy to talk about 
the racial violence of white people anymore
yes all white people 
when you call us a bunch of violent racists
[all of us=

[where does slavery come from?

=all of us 
we are going to get annoyed

yeah of course but look at the responses that I got that I’ve got
how dare you call us racist you black
how dare you call [us racist= 

        [no I said I don’t agr-

=go back to the trees[=		

  [no you can al- wha- of course you-

=that [says it all people don’t know what racism is=

          [of course you can find- 

=[we’re not taught about racism= 

  [of- of course you can-

=no Piers let me speak [I came in here to-

     [you can find abusive responses- 

Piers I came in here to speak
I came in here to speak [Piers-

			      [you did and I came in 
and I also wanted you in here 
so that I could look you in the eye
and say I think what you said was [(…)-

[so you're 
making it about you [Piers-
 
            [no what it's my show 
along with [Susanna. 

        [okay why don't you just sit here 
and talk for five minutes then 
and I just sat- [sit here-

 [uh you've done plenty of talking Munroe
I’ve been watching your interviews 
I want you to explain why we shouldn't be offended 
as white people
by your sentence that all white people
all white people are party to racial violence

because socialization has placed 
all white people in a certain privilege
that means that if you are not dismantling racism 
or helping to dismantle racism 
then you are part of the problem 
because you that makes you complicit 
you need to actively work with people of color 
to put diversity which this campaign was about
into place and when L'oreal fires me 
for speaking about the origins of racism
then that goes completely against what diversity is 
because the reason why we need diversity is 
because we have racism [in society.
         
         [you don't think any white people 
on the planet are currently doing what you've just suggested

I didn't say that 

you by implication when you say 
[all white people that is what you’re saying.

[I’m talking about a structure 
I’m talking about a structure that all white people sit on 
I’m talking about society I’m not talking about 
literally every single white person 
I’m talking about society and
all white people exist within that structure 

well I’m I’m asking if you
regret the form of words 
because of the [way they come across?

   [no I don't refr- regret the form of words 
i mean I’m an activist and at the end of the day 
activists aren't there to go and say a bunch of stuff 
that people like
we are there to call things out and to make change
and yes I said all white people because
all white people have access to the privileges
um that are- 
[that come out of colonialism and slavery=

[really really you think that the y-

=[yes!

  [you think you think the hundreds of thousands 
of people on food banks in this country
white people amongst them 
are are [privileged, do you?

 [they have more count 
they have more [privileges-

    [more privileges than you 

i did not say that I did [not say that- 

  [a wealthy supermodel

i did not- uh please show me my bank account

all right you'll be you’ll make a lot of money out of this so 
let me ask you again do you think that 
white people on food banks in this country
are more or less privileged than you 

I did not say that Piers I said[-

 [you just implied that
 you said that [all white people had privileges. 

 [no Piers-
let me speak please I’m saying that if a person is at th-
the food banks and their white 
and there's their counterpart
and that counterpart is black 
that white person has more of a chance of getting out that situation 
than their black [counterpart. 

    [why where's the evidence for that 

because of white privilege
[they have-

[really

white people have more access to 
home- [to housing, to credit-

[so so- poor white people just to clarify 
poor white people have a better chance in Britain 
of getting out of their poverty than 
than poor black [people? 

     [yes.

all of them 

i feel like I’m up against a wall with your Piers[-

        [no you're not
what you're up against is somebody challenging you 
on your public statements=

=yes= 

which you've managed to turn into a massive great story
of your poor victimhood 
and I’m telling you 
now you're sitting here that I think when you say
all white people are racially violent=

=mm=

=that is deeply offensive and I think when you then clarify 
[and say that straight=

[i think that it's deeply offensive that history is-

=straight white guys are basically all sexist homophobes
and racially violent[=

		         [I did not(…)-

=i as a straight white guy 
who's not remotely racist get very offended by that 

and this is why there's a problem 
because you take it [personally. 

           [there is a problem 
because I do take it personally [yes.

      [it isn't a personal attack 

of course it is 

it's not a personal attack Piers
[and this is why we are not gonna get=

[you’ve attacked every white person in the world

=this is why aren’t gonna get anywhere with racism because 
[people with extreme pri- privilege like yourself= 

[well we won’t when you keep inflaming people-

=can't see past it and want to attack people 
when they talk about their lived experience

=mm=

i am speaking[- 

[we've all had lived experiences

[well obviously because we’re all living Piers-

[good bad and ugly all of us right
I I resent the idea that all
white people in this modern era 
are automatically more privileged 
than all black people 
I don't think that's right anymore
i think it's a complete mischaracterization 
of the work that's been done to counter racism around the world
and I think when you as a very high profile 
transgender model get this amazing opportunity
to have a platform at L'oreal the first thing you do 
I I (agree the [timing from before)=

 	            [it was not the first thing I did Piers

=alright but it ca- the first thing that [comes out-  
    
    [the timeline was completely [(wrong)- 

        [right
but this is a [public Facebook post-
 
         [it came out because it was uh 
[it was an attack on my character=

[I don’t- alright-

=[and it was taken out of context. 

  [I don’t unders- I d- I-
i get it I just said that 
but I don't understand how I’m saying 
that all white people are racially violent
helps anyone in the race debate that's my point 

okay well we need to speak about why um 
the syllabus is so white 
why we are not taught about the violence of slavery in schools 
why aren't we aren’t talk about the violence of um colonialism 
why we're not taught about the violence of the empire 
we are taught a whitewashed history 
kids are not taught about black history in the same way 
that they are taught about white [history. 

 				          [then why don't you say that

i did [i did!
	
         [yeah but that- but yeah but
that's not what got the headlines [what-

           [no because Piers 
it got [taken out of context=

          [had you focussed- yeah b- Munroe-

=someone screenshotted it and sold the story 
to the Daily [Mail.

         [had you focused on why we should have 
more historical knowledge
[of slavery and issues like that-

[Piers I did and this is what I’m saying 
the bookends got taken out 

well the bookends were so inflammatory and offensive 
of course they got [taken out.

         [no they didn't get get [taken out.

[and blaming the daily mail 
for what you said is ridiculous 

well of course you would say that Piers 
because you work for the Daily Mail 

yes I work for them but if they were wrong
I would also say they're wrong 
I’ve just quoted you back directly
what you actually posted 
[and don’t pretend-

[Piers you didn’t 
because it was taken out of context 
you missed out the two bits 
that you haven’t [seen.

     [I’m not sure how you take out of context
that all white people are 
guilty of racial [violence. 

   it’s basic socialization and racial theory Piers 
look it up

it has been fascinating watching the debate
thanks so much for joining us [Munroe Bergdorf

      [welcome.

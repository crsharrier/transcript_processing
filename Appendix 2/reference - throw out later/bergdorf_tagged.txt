\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=i don't have the energy to talk about
the racial violence of white people\overmk{B3}[=

\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=um do you think that all white people are racist
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}i don't think that all white people are by nature racist
um from conception to birth
i think that  we are all the same um
but we need to speak about how we're socialized as a people
and er my resp- my um post was based on socialization
and racism as a structure
um I think as a society we’re just taught certain things
we're taught that men are superior to women
we're taught that women are meant to be submissive
we're told that gay people are meant to be ashamed of their sexuality
but it doesn't mean that this is how things need to be
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}do you think all people
all white people are responsible for that
or \overmk{B5}[believe that or?
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B5}}[um I don't think that all white people believe it no
i think that there is cases um
well I mean there's loads of allies I mean
you don't need to think this way
and it takes actively dismantling racism to be an ally
because if you're not doing anything then how are you helping racism
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}so you s- you said uh when you explained about this
you said white people are racist due to socialization
in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist\overmk{B6}[=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B6}}[uhuh.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=and heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic so\overmk{B7}[=

\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B9}}[no
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=so i'm a racist sexist homophobe

\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B10}}[well yeah sexist yes but I \overmk{B11}[wouldn’t-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B11}}[I’m not sexist

\medskip
\spkr{Piers}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B12}}[and i'm not racist
and i'm not a homophobe
so who are you with the greatest of respect to you
who are you to say that every
straight white guy \overmk{B13}[in the world is a-
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B13}}[I did not say that.
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}well you did you said white people are racist
due \overmk{B14}[to socialization=
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B14}}[I just-
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}=in the same way that men are socialized to be sexist
heterosexual people are socialized to be homophobic
you are calling straight white guys like me
a series of offensive stereotypical labels

\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\hspace{\offset{A1}{B15}}[and this is where there’s a problem-
okay this is why there's a problem

please let me speak instead of speaking over me

\spkr{Piers}the floor is yours

there's a divide anyway
we need to be speaking about what the s-

\spkr{Piers}I'm saying the five most powerful people in britain are women
so this idea that men still rule the entire planet

\spkr{Munroe}\overmk{B57}[uh you've done plenty of talking Munroe
I’ve been watching your interviews
I want you to explain why we shouldn't be offended
as white people
by your sentence that all white people
all white people are party to racial violence
\medskip
\spkr{Piers}because socialization has placed
all white people in a certain privilege
that means that if you are not dismantling racism
or helping to dismantle racism
then you are part of the problem
because you that makes you complicit
you need to actively work with people of color
to put diversity which this campaign was about
into place and when L'oreal fires me
for speaking about the origins of racism
then that goes completely against what diversity is
because the reason why we need diversity is
because we have racism \hspace{\offset{A1}{B57}}[in society.
\medskip
\spkr{Munroe}\overmk{B58}[you don't think any white people
on the planet are currently doing what you've just suggested

activists aren't there to go and say a bunch of stuff

all white people have access to the privileges

let me speak please i'm saying that if a person is at th-

that white person has more of a chance of getting out that situation
